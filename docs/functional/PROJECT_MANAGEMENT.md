# Project Management

This guide covers creating, configuring, and managing your ExperienceQR projects.

## Understanding Projects

A **project** (also called an "experience") is a self-contained content experience that you share with your audience via QR codes, links, or embeds. Each project has its own:

- Content (text, images, links)
- QR codes (one or multiple)
- AI assistant settings
- Translations
- Analytics

## Project Limits by Plan

| Plan | Maximum Projects |
|------|------------------|
| Free | 3 |
| Starter | 5 |
| Premium | 35 |

## Creating a New Project

### Step 1: Start Creation

1. Navigate to **My Projects**
2. Click **+ New Project**

### Step 2: Basic Information

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Project Name** | Yes | Display name for visitors (keep it short) |
| **Description** | No | Brief overview shown to visitors |
| **Cover Image** | No | Main visual for your project |

**Tips:**
- Names should be clear and descriptive
- Descriptions should tell visitors what to expect
- Cover images should be high-quality (recommended: 1200×800 pixels)

### Step 3: Display Mode

Choose how content appears to visitors:

#### Single Mode
- **Best for:** Single articles, announcements, detailed exhibits
- **Layout:** One content item fills the screen
- **Use when:** You have one main piece of information

#### List Mode
- **Best for:** Resource directories, link-in-bio, menus
- **Layout:** Vertical scrolling list
- **Use when:** You have multiple items visitors browse sequentially

#### Grid Mode
- **Best for:** Photo galleries, product catalogs, visual collections
- **Layout:** 2-column masonry grid
- **Use when:** Visual items are equally important

#### Cards Mode
- **Best for:** Featured content, news, highlights
- **Layout:** Full-width cards with large images
- **Use when:** Each item deserves prominent display

### Step 4: Content Grouping (Optional)

Enable **Grouped Content** to organize items into categories:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Ungrouped** | All items shown in flat list |
| **Grouped (Expanded)** | Categories shown with items visible |
| **Grouped (Collapsed)** | Categories shown, tap to see items |

**Example:** A museum might group by floor or exhibit type.
