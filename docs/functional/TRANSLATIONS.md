## Translation Updates

4. Or manually update translations

### Syncing Translations

| Approach | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Full re-translate** | Major content overhaul |
| **Selective translate** | Minor updates |
| **Manual edit** | Small corrections |

## Visitor Language Experience

### Automatic Detection

When visitors access your project:

1. System checks their browser language
2. Matches to available translation
3. Defaults to English if no match

### Language Selector

Visitors can also:

1. See language selector in the interface
2. Choose their preferred language
3. Content and AI switch to that language

### AI in Multiple Languages

When translations are set up:

- AI responds in visitor's selected language
- Uses translated knowledge base
- Maintains conversation in chosen language

## Translation Quality

### AI Translation Strengths

- ✅ Fast and consistent
- ✅ Good for straightforward content
- ✅ Handles most languages well
- ✅ Cost-effective for bulk content

### AI Translation Limitations

- ⚠️ Idioms may not translate well
- ⚠️ Technical jargon needs review
- ⚠️ Cultural nuances may be missed
- ⚠️ Proper nouns may be incorrectly translated

### Improving Quality

1. **Write clearly** in original language
2. **Avoid idioms** and slang
3. **Use simple sentences** when possible
4. **Review translations** before publishing
5. **Get native speaker feedback** if possible

## Language-Specific Tips

### Chinese (Traditional vs Simplified)

- Traditional: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau
- Simplified: Mainland China, Singapore
- Different character sets, similar meaning
- Consider your audience location

### Arabic

- Right-to-left (RTL) script
- Layout adjusts automatically
- Test thoroughly on mobile

### Japanese

- Formal vs informal tone matters
- Technical terms often kept in English
- Review for appropriate politeness level

### Korean

- Formal vs informal speech levels
- Review for cultural appropriateness
- Romanization of names may need checking

## Managing Multiple Languages

### Prioritizing Languages

Consider:
1. Your visitor demographics
2. Location of your venue
3. Tourism patterns
4. Available review resources

**Example priority for a Paris museum:**
1. French (local)
2. English (international tourists)
3. Chinese (growing tourism)
4. Spanish (European visitors)

### Starter Plan Strategy (2 languages)

Choose strategically:
- English + most common visitor language
- Or your local language + English

### Maintenance

For each language:
- [ ] Initial translation reviewed
- [ ] Native speaker check (if possible)
- [ ] Cultural adaptations made
- [ ] Tested in visitor view
- [ ] Updated when content changes

## Troubleshooting

### Translation Failed

**Possible causes:**
- Content too long for single request
- Network issues during translation
- Special characters causing issues

**Solutions:**
- Retry the translation
- Translate in smaller batches
- Remove problematic characters
- Contact support if persistent

### Translation Quality Poor

**Solutions:**
- Edit manually

### Language Not Showing for Visitors
