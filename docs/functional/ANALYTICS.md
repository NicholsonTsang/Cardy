# Analytics & Usage

This guide covers tracking visitor engagement, understanding usage metrics, and making data-driven decisions.

## Analytics Overview

FunTell provides analytics to help you understand:

- How many visitors access your content
- Which QR codes are most popular
- When visitors engage most
- How AI features are used
- Budget consumption patterns

## Dashboard Metrics

### Subscription Overview

Your main dashboard shows:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Budget Used** | USD spent this billing period |
| **Budget Remaining** | USD available until reset |
| **Total Sessions** | All sessions this period |
| **AI Sessions** | Sessions on AI-enabled projects |
| **Non-AI Sessions** | Sessions on non-AI projects |

### Usage Chart

Visual display of daily sessions showing:
- Total sessions per day
- AI vs non-AI breakdown
- Trends over time
- Budget consumption rate

## Project-Level Analytics

### Accessing Project Analytics

1. Open a project
2. Go to **Analytics** or view in overview

### Project Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Sessions** | All-time visitor sessions |
| **This Month** | Current month sessions |
| **Today** | Sessions since midnight |
| **AI Conversations** | Chat/voice interactions |

### QR Code Performance

Each QR code tracks:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Scans** | All-time access count |
| **Daily Scans** | Today's count |
| **Monthly Scans** | Current month count |
| **Location** | Your assigned name |

## Understanding Sessions

### What Counts as a Session?

A session is recorded when:
- Visitor scans QR code and loads content
- Page fully loads (not just the scan)
- At least 30 minutes since last session from same visitor

### What Doesn't Count?

- Same visitor within 30 minutes (deduplicated)
- Your own testing from dashboard preview
- Failed loads (network errors)

### Session vs Page View

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Session** | One visitor accessing your project |
| **Page View** | Each page/item viewed within session |

Sessions are billed; page views within a session are free.

## AI Usage Analytics

### AI Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **AI Sessions** | Sessions where AI was available |
| **Conversations Started** | Visitors who opened chat/voice |
| **Messages Sent** | Total chat messages |
| **Voice Minutes** | Real-time voice usage |

### AI Engagement Rate

Calculate how many visitors use AI:

```
Engagement Rate = (Conversations Started ÷ AI Sessions) × 100
```

**Good benchmark:** 10-30% engagement rate

## Time-Based Analysis

### Daily Patterns

Identify peak times:
- When do most visitors access?
- Weekday vs weekend patterns
- Seasonal variations

### Using Time Data

- **Staff scheduling:** More staff during peak times
- **Content updates:** Update before busy periods
- **Maintenance:** Schedule during low periods

## Location Analysis

### Multiple QR Codes

If you have multiple QR codes per project:

| Analysis | Insight |
|----------|---------|
| **Compare scans** | Which locations are most popular |
| **Time patterns** | When each location is busiest |
| **Conversion** | Which codes lead to AI usage |

### Optimizing Placement

Based on analytics:
- Move underperforming QR codes
- Add codes to high-traffic areas
- Remove codes from unused locations
- Improve signage at low-performing spots

## Budget Analysis

### Budget Consumption Rate

Monitor how fast you're using budget:

```
Daily Rate = Budget Used ÷ Days Elapsed
Projected Monthly = Daily Rate × 30
```

### Budget Alerts

Watch for:
- ⚠️ Using faster than expected
- ⚠️ Approaching monthly limit
- ⚠️ Sudden usage spikes

### Optimizing Budget

**If budget runs out too fast:**
- Disable AI on low-value projects
- Set daily limits on QR codes
- Purchase overage credits
- Consider plan upgrade

**If budget unused:**
- You're under-utilizing
- Consider downgrading plan
- Or expand to more projects

## Exporting Data

### Export Options

Download your data for external analysis:

1. Go to project or subscription page
2. Click **Export** or **Download Report**
3. Choose format and date range
4. Download file

### Export Formats

| Format | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **CSV** | Spreadsheet analysis |
| **Excel** | Detailed reporting |
| **PDF** | Sharing summaries |

### Data Included

- Session counts by date
- QR code performance
- AI usage metrics
- Budget consumption

## Setting Goals

### Suggested Metrics to Track

| Goal Type | Metric | Target Example |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Reach** | Total sessions | 500/month |
| **Engagement** | AI conversation rate | 20% |
| **Growth** | Month-over-month | +10% |
| **Efficiency** | Cost per session | Under $0.05 |

### Benchmarking

Compare your metrics:
- This month vs last month
- This year vs last year
- Project vs project
- QR code vs QR code

## Common Analytics Questions

### "Are visitors actually using this?"

Check:
- Session count (are people scanning?)
- AI engagement rate (are they interacting?)
- Return rate (are they coming back?)

### "Which QR code should I focus on?"

Compare:
- Total sessions per code
- Growth rate per code
- Location foot traffic vs scan rate

### "Is AI worth the extra cost?"

Calculate:
```
AI Value = (AI Sessions × Engagement Rate × Perceived Value) vs Extra Cost
```

Consider:
- Does AI improve visitor experience?
- Are visitors asking questions?
- Could content alone suffice?

### "When should I upgrade my plan?"

Upgrade when:
- Consistently hitting session limits
- Need more projects
- Want more translation languages
- Approaching budget limit monthly

## Troubleshooting Analytics

### Sessions Not Showing

**Possible causes:**
- Analytics delay (up to 30 minutes)
- Session was deduplicated
- Network issue during load

**Solutions:**
- Wait and refresh
- Check specific QR code stats
- Test with fresh session (wait 30 min)

### Unexpected Spike in Usage

**Investigate:**
- Which project/QR code?
- What time period?
- Legitimate traffic or issue?

**Possible causes:**
- Marketing campaign success
- Social media mention
- Bot/spam traffic
- QR code in high-traffic area

### Data Doesn't Match Expectations

**Check:**
- Correct date range selected
- Right project selected
- Account for deduplication
- Time zone differences

## Best Practices

### Regular Reviews

| Frequency | Review |
|-----------|--------|
| **Daily** | Quick check of budget usage |
| **Weekly** | Session trends, any anomalies |
| **Monthly** | Full performance review |
| **Quarterly** | Strategic planning, plan review |

### Acting on Data

| Insight | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Low sessions on a project | Improve QR placement, signage |
| High AI engagement | Consider more AI content |
| Budget running out | Adjust settings or upgrade |
| One QR code dominates | Add codes elsewhere |
| Weekend spikes | Prepare for busy periods |
