## Understanding Sessions

### What is a Session?

A **session** is counted when a visitor accesses your project. Sessions are:

- Counted once per visitor per 30-minute window
- Billed at different rates based on AI setting
- Tracked in real-time

### AI vs Non-AI Sessions

| Project Type | Starter Cost | Premium Cost | Enterprise Cost |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| AI Enabled | $0.05 | $0.04 | $0.02 |
| AI Disabled | $0.025 | $0.02 | $0.01 |

**Tip:** Disable AI on projects that don't need it to reduce session costs.

### Session Budget Example

**Premium Plan ($280/month):**

If all projects have AI enabled:
- $280 ÷ $0.04 = 7,000 sessions

If all projects are non-AI:
- $280 ÷ $0.02 = 14,000 sessions

Mixed usage (50/50):
- 3,500 AI sessions ($140) + 7,000 non-AI sessions ($140) = 10,500 total

### Session Deduplication

To prevent abuse, the same visitor scanning multiple times within 30 minutes counts as **one session**. This protects your budget from:
- Accidental double-scans
- Page refreshes
- Testing

### How Credits Work

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Purchase | Credits added to your account |
| Usage | Deducted when monthly budget exhausted |
| Expiration | Credits don't expire |
| Rate | Same session rates as your plan |

### Credit Example

- Or 2,500 non-AI sessions ($0.02 each)
- Credits used only after monthly budget depleted

### Auto Top-Up

Automatically purchase credits when your session budget runs low. Configure a threshold and top-up amount in your Subscription settings. When your remaining budget drops below the threshold, additional credits are purchased automatically using your saved payment method.

## Voice Credits

### What Are Voice Credits?

Voice credits are a **separate purchase** from your subscription session budget. They are required for real-time voice calls (live AI conversations) and are **not included** in any subscription plan.

- **1 voice credit = 1 voice call**
- Each call has a hard time limit of **180 seconds** (3 minutes)
- Voice credits do not expire

### Purchasing Voice Credits

1. Go to **Subscription** or **Credit Management**
2. Click **Buy Voice Credits**
3. Select the number of packages (each package contains 35 credits for $5)
4. Credits are deducted from your session credit balance instantly

### Voice Credits vs Session Credits

| Aspect | Session Credits | Voice Credits |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Included in plan** | Yes (monthly budget) | No (purchased separately) |
| **Used for** | Visitor page access | Real-time voice calls |
| **Cost** | Varies by plan/AI setting | $5 per 35 credits |
| **Expiration** | Resets monthly (budget) / Never (overage) | Never |

### Enabling Voice on Projects

Creators must toggle **`realtime_voice_enabled`** on each project where they want to offer real-time voice conversations. Voice credits are consumed from the **project owner's** balance when a visitor starts a call.
