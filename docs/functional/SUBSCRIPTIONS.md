## Understanding Sessions

### What is a Session?

A **session** is counted when a visitor accesses your project. Sessions are:

- Counted once per visitor per 30-minute window
- Billed at different rates based on AI setting
- Tracked in real-time

### AI vs Non-AI Sessions

| Project Type | Starter Cost | Premium Cost |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| AI Enabled | $0.05 | $0.04 |
| AI Disabled | $0.025 | $0.02 |

**Tip:** Disable AI on projects that don't need it to reduce session costs.

### Session Budget Example

**Premium Plan ($280/month):**

If all projects have AI enabled:
- $280 ÷ $0.04 = 7,000 sessions

If all projects are non-AI:
- $280 ÷ $0.02 = 14,000 sessions

Mixed usage (50/50):
- 3,500 AI sessions ($140) + 7,000 non-AI sessions ($140) = 10,500 total

### Session Deduplication

To prevent abuse, the same visitor scanning multiple times within 30 minutes counts as **one session**. This protects your budget from:
- Accidental double-scans
- Page refreshes
- Testing
