   - CardOverview.vue
   - ContentList.vue
   - ContentDetail.vue

### Phase 2: Admin Panel (Lower Priority)

   - UserManagement.vue
   - PrintRequests.vue
   - OperationsLog.vue
   - UserCardsView.vue
   - etc.

### Phase 3: Shared Components (As Needed)

## 🔧 HOW TO TEST

### Test SignIn Page:

1. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to sign-in:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/login
   ```

3. **Test language switching:**
   - Click language switcher in header
   - Select "English" - page updates to English
   - Select "繁體中文" - page updates to Traditional Chinese
   - Try form validation - errors show in selected language
   - Try forgot password - dialog text in selected language

4. **Test persistence:**
   - Select a language
   - Refresh page
   - Language preference persists

## 📝 NEXT COMPONENTS TO MIGRATE

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **SignUp.vue** (Similar to SignIn)
   - Copy translation approach from SignIn
   - Update all hardcoded text
   - Test with English & Traditional Chinese

2. **ResetPassword.vue**
   - Simpler than SignIn
   - Only a few strings to translate

3. **MyCards.vue** (Dashboard)
   - Main dashboard page
   - Card list
   - Action buttons
   - Empty states

## 🌍 TRANSLATION KEYS STRUCTURE

All translation keys follow this pattern:

```
common.*          // Shared UI (save, cancel, delete, etc.)
auth.*            // Authentication pages
dashboard.*       // Dashboard & card management
content.*         // Content management
batches.*         // Batch issuance
admin.*           // Admin panel
mobile.*          // Mobile client
validation.*      // Form validation
messages.*        // Toast/alerts
```

### Example Usage in Components:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- Simple translation -->
  <h1>{{ $t('auth.welcome_back') }}</h1>
  
  <!-- With binding -->
  <Button :label="$t('common.save')" />
  
  <!-- In script -->
  <script setup>
  import { useI18n } from 'vue-i18n'
  const { t } = useI18n()
  
  function showError() {
    errorMessage.value = t('auth.sign_in_error')
  }
  </script>
</template>
```
