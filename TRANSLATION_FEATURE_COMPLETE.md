## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure feature adoption:

1. **Adoption Rate**: % of cards with at least 1 translation
2. **Language Coverage**: Average languages per card
3. **Translation Quality**: Re-translation rate (should be low)
4. **Revenue**: Credits spent on translations
5. **Visitor Engagement**: % of visitors using non-English languages

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **AI Knowledge Base**: Not translated (kept in original language for consistency)
2. **Proper Nouns**: May be transliterated rather than translated
3. **Markdown Formatting**: Preserved but may need manual adjustment for complex cases
4. **No Preview**: Users can't preview before translating (would double GPT costs)
5. **No Partial Retry**: If translation fails mid-way, need to re-translate all languages

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Translation fails with "Insufficient credits"
- **Solution**: Purchase more credits via Credit Management page

**Issue**: Translations marked as outdated immediately
- **Solution**: Content was edited after translation; update translations

**Issue**: Mobile client shows original language
- **Solution**: Card not translated to that language yet; translate via dashboard

**Issue**: Edge Function returns 401
- **Solution**: Check JWT token validation in Edge Function

## 🎉 Conclusion

The multi-language translation feature is now fully operational! Card issuers can provide visitors with rich, AI-translated content in 10 languages, greatly enhancing the international visitor experience at museums, exhibitions, and cultural sites.
