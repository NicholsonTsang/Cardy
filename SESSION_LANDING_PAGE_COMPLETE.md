## 🔧 Technical Fixes

### 5. **Animation Visibility Fix**
- ✅ Progressive enhancement pattern
- ✅ Content visible by default (accessibility-first)
- ✅ Animations only apply when Observer is ready
- ✅ Triple fallback system:
  - Level 1: CSS default (visible)
  - Level 2: Intersection Observer (animations)
  - Level 3: 3-second timeout (force visible)
- ✅ Stats show real values immediately (no empty numbers)

### 6. **Responsive Navigation Fixes**
- ✅ Changed breakpoint from `md` (768px) to `lg` (1024px)
- ✅ Hamburger menu now hidden on large screens
- ✅ Used `lg:!hidden` with `!important` to override PrimeVue styles
- ✅ Mobile menu dropdown synchronized with breakpoint
- ✅ Perfect separation: no overlap at any screen size
