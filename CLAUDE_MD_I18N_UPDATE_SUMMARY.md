# CLAUDE.md i18n Update Summary

## Context
User reported console warnings for missing i18n keys in `zh-Hans` locale:
- `content.content_item`
- `content.basic_information`
- `content.description`
- `content.ai_knowledge_info`

## Analysis
These warnings occur because `zh-Hans` (Simplified Chinese) is a **placeholder language** with incomplete translations. While recently integrated for Chinese voice selection (text script differentiation), Dashboard UI translations remain incomplete and fall back to English.

## CLAUDE.md Updates

### Section: Internationalization (Line 418-435)

**Added clarification under "Chinese Voice Selection":**
```markdown
- **Important**: `zh-Hans` remains a placeholder language with incomplete translations. While it's used for text script differentiation in Chinese voice selection, Dashboard UI for Simplified Chinese users will fall back to English for missing keys. This is expected behavior.
```

**Updated "Console Warnings":**
```markdown
- **Console Warnings**: i18n fallback warnings for placeholder languages (zh-Hans, ko, ja, etc.) are expected and can be ignored. These occur when Dashboard UI elements don't have translations in placeholder locales.
```

## Key Points Clarified

1. **zh-Hans Status**: Remains a placeholder language despite being used for voice selection
2. **Expected Behavior**: Dashboard UI fallback to English for missing keys is intentional
3. **Console Warnings**: Are expected and can be safely ignored for placeholder languages
4. **Translation Policy**: Only `en` and `zh-Hant` should be updated when adding new features
5. **Voice Selection**: Works correctly despite incomplete Dashboard translations

## Why This Matters

**Before the update**, developers might be confused:
- "Why does Chinese voice selection use zh-Hans if it's not maintained?"
- "Should we fix these console warnings?"
- "Is zh-Hans now an active language?"

**After the update**, it's clear:
- zh-Hans is used for text script differentiation in voice selection only
- Dashboard UI translations being incomplete is documented and expected
- No action needed for these console warnings
- Translation policy remains: only en and zh-Hant are actively maintained
