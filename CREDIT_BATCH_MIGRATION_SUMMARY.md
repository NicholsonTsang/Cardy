# Credit-Based Batch Issuance Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the batch issuance system from legacy direct Stripe payment to credit-based system.

## Date
October 11, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. **CardIssuanceCheckout.vue** - Complete Refactor
**Location**: `/src/components/CardIssuanceCheckout.vue`

**Removed**:
- ❌ `createCheckoutSession()` - Legacy Stripe checkout for batch payment
- ❌ `handlePayment()` - Payment initiation logic
- ❌ `handleCheckoutSuccess()` - Payment callback handling
- ❌ Stripe redirect flow during batch creation
- ❌ Payment pending states and success redirects

**Added**:
- ✅ `useCreditStore` integration
- ✅ Real-time credit balance display in dialog
- ✅ `requiredCredits` computed property (2 credits × card count)
- ✅ `hasEnoughCredits` computed property
- ✅ `updateCreditEstimate()` - Updates display on card count change
- ✅ `navigateToCreditPurchase()` - Redirects to `/cms/credits`
- ✅ `creditStore.issueBatchWithCredits()` - Direct batch creation with credits

**UI Changes**:
- Credit balance indicator (blue if sufficient, orange if insufficient)
- Required credits display next to card count input
- Conditional dialog footer buttons:
  - If sufficient credits: "Create Batch" button (blue)
  - If insufficient: "Purchase Credits" button (orange)
- Insufficient credits warning panel with purchase button
- Updated "What happens next?" info panel with credit-based flow

**Flow Changes**:
```
OLD FLOW:
Click "Issue Batch" → Enter card count → "Pay & Issue" → 
Stripe Checkout → Payment Success → Redirect back → Batch created

NEW FLOW:
Click "Issue Batch" → See balance & required credits → 
If insufficient: Click "Purchase Credits" → Buy credits → Return →
If sufficient: Click "Create Batch" → Instant batch creation ✨
```

### 2. **Translations** - Added Credit-Based Messages
**File**: `/src/i18n/locales/en.json`

**New Keys**:
```json
{
  "create_batch": "Create Batch",
  "credits_required": "Credits Required",
  "credits": "credits",
  "your_balance": "Your Balance",
  "insufficient_credits": "Insufficient Credits",
  "insufficient_credits_message": "You need {required} credits but only have {balance} credits available.",
  "insufficient_credits_error": "Insufficient credits to create this batch. Please purchase more credits.",
  "purchase_credits": "Purchase Credits",
  "what_happens_next": "What happens next?",
  "credits_will_be_consumed": "{credits} credits will be consumed from your balance",
  "batch_created_instantly": "Batch will be created instantly",
  "cards_generated_immediately": "Cards will be generated immediately",
  "ready_for_distribution": "Ready for distribution right away",
  "batch_created": "Batch Created!",
  "batch_created_successfully": "Batch created successfully with {count} cards",
  "batch_creation_failed": "Failed to create batch"
}
```

### 3. **Edge Function Fix** - create-checkout-session
**File**: `/supabase/functions/create-checkout-session/index.ts`

**Issue**: Function hoisting error - `isValidUrl()` called before definition
**Fix**: Moved `isValidUrl` helper function definition before its first usage (line 54)

**Note**: This function is now **DEPRECATED** but kept for backward compatibility. New implementations should not use this function.

### 4. **Documentation Updates** - CLAUDE.md
**File**: `/CLAUDE.md`

**Updated Sections**:
- Card Issuer Flow: Added detailed credit-based batch issuance steps
- Payments & Credits: Documented credit-based flow with stored procedure details
- Common Issues: Added migration notes distinguishing current vs legacy systems

## Backend Integration

### Stored Procedures Used

1. **`issue_card_batch_with_credits()`** - Main function
   - Location: `sql/storeproc/client-side/04_batch_management.sql`
   - Checks credit balance
   - Creates batch with `payment_method = 'credits'`
   - Consumes credits atomically
   - Generates issued cards immediately
   - All operations transaction-safe (rollback on failure)

2. **`check_credit_balance()`** - Balance validation
   - Location: `sql/storeproc/client-side/credit_management.sql`
   - Returns boolean if user has sufficient credits

3. **`consume_credits_for_batch()`** - Credit consumption
   - Location: `sql/storeproc/client-side/credit_management.sql`
   - Locks user_credits row (FOR UPDATE)
   - Updates balance
   - Records consumption and transaction
   - Links to batch via batch_id

### Credit Store Methods Used

**Store**: `src/stores/credits.ts`

- `fetchCreditBalance()` - Load user balance on mount
- `issueBatchWithCredits()` - Create batch with credit consumption
- `balance` (computed) - Current credit balance
- `formattedBalance` (computed) - Formatted balance display

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Migration
1. User clicks "Issue Batch"
2. Enters card count, sees dollar amount ($2.00 per card)
3. Clicks "Pay & Issue"
4. Redirected to Stripe Checkout
5. Completes payment (external site)
6. Redirected back to app
7. Batch created after webhook processing
8. **Total time: ~2-5 minutes**

### After Migration
1. User purchases credits once via `/cms/credits` (one-time setup)
2. User clicks "Issue Batch"
3. Sees credit balance and required credits in real-time
4. If insufficient: One-click redirect to purchase more
5. If sufficient: Clicks "Create Batch"
6. Batch created instantly ✨
7. Cards generated immediately
8. **Total time: ~2-3 seconds**

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Instant Batch Creation** - No Stripe redirect delays
2. ✅ **Better UX** - Real-time credit balance visibility
3. ✅ **Bulk Operations** - Purchase credits once, create multiple batches
4. ✅ **Predictable Costs** - Users see exact credit requirements upfront
5. ✅ **Simplified Flow** - Fewer steps, clearer process
6. ✅ **Transaction Safety** - Atomic credit consumption with rollback support
7. ✅ **Error Handling** - Clear insufficient credit messages with purchase CTA

## Backward Compatibility

The legacy `create-checkout-session` Edge Function remains functional but is **DEPRECATED**:
- ⚠️ Kept for backward compatibility only
- ⚠️ Not recommended for new implementations
- ⚠️ Fixed function hoisting bug for existing users
- ✅ Should be removed in a future major version

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Load batch issuance dialog - verify credit balance displays
- [ ] Test with sufficient credits - verify instant batch creation
- [ ] Test with insufficient credits - verify warning and purchase button
- [ ] Click "Purchase Credits" - verify redirect to `/cms/credits`
- [ ] Create batch - verify credits consumed correctly
- [ ] Verify transaction logged in credit_transactions table
- [ ] Verify consumption logged in credit_consumptions table
- [ ] Verify batch has `payment_method = 'credits'`
- [ ] Verify issued cards generated immediately
- [ ] Test error handling - simulate insufficient credits during creation
- [ ] Verify credit balance refreshes after batch creation

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/components/CardIssuanceCheckout.vue` - Complete refactor
2. ✅ `src/i18n/locales/en.json` - Added translations
3. ✅ `supabase/functions/create-checkout-session/index.ts` - Fixed hoisting bug
4. ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Updated documentation

## Files Created

1. ✅ `CREDIT_BATCH_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Next Steps (User Action Required)

1. **Test the Flow** - Create a batch with credits to verify it works
2. **Update Other Languages** - Add translations to other locale files if needed
3. **Monitor Production** - Check for any edge cases after deployment
4. **Consider Removing Legacy** - Plan deprecation timeline for `create-checkout-session`

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check credit balance: `SELECT * FROM user_credits WHERE user_id = auth.uid()`
2. Check recent transactions: Use `get_credit_transactions()` RPC
3. Verify batch creation: Check `batches` table for `payment_method = 'credits'`
4. Check console errors in CardIssuanceCheckout.vue
