# Language Selector Improvements - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Issues Fixed

### üîß Issue 1: Language Box Size Too Small

**Problem:** Language option boxes in the selector were too small, making them hard to tap and less visually prominent.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Increased grid column minimum width**: `140px` ‚Üí `160px`
2. **Increased gap between items**: `1rem` ‚Üí `1.25rem`
3. **Increased padding**: `1.25rem 1rem` ‚Üí `1.5rem 1.25rem`
4. **Increased minimum height**: `44px` ‚Üí `100px`
5. **Increased flag emoji size**: `2.5rem` ‚Üí `3rem` (desktop), `2rem` ‚Üí `2.5rem` (mobile)
6. **Increased gap between flag and name**: `0.5rem` ‚Üí `0.625rem`

**Result:** Language boxes are now ~15-20% larger with more comfortable tap targets and better visual hierarchy.

### üêõ Issue 2: English Language Selection Bug

**Problem:** When the app was in English, the language selector in the header couldn't switch to other languages. The selection would appear to work but would revert back to English on navigation or component re-render.

**Root Cause:** 

The `MobileHeader` component had `:track-selection="false"`, which prevented the language selection from being properly persisted. Here's why this caused the bug:

1. When you selected a language with `trackSelection=false`:
   - Language changed in the store ‚úÖ
   - `setLocale()` saved to `localStorage` ‚úÖ
   - But `sessionStorage.setItem('userSelectedLanguage', 'true')` was NOT set ‚ùå

2. When the language store re-initialized (e.g., on navigation):
   - It checked: `sessionStorage.getItem('userSelectedLanguage') === 'true'`
   - Since this was false, it didn't read from `localStorage`
   - It defaulted back to English ‚ùå

3. This happened more noticeably with English because:
   - English is the default fallback language
   - If you were in any other language and it failed, it fell back to English
   - So the bug was most obvious when starting from English

**Changes Made:**

```diff
// MobileHeader.vue
<UnifiedLanguageModal 
  v-model="showLanguageModal"
  :show-trigger="true"
- :track-selection="false"
+ :track-selection="true"
+ @select="handleLanguageSelect"
/>
```

Added `handleLanguageSelect()` function to properly handle the language selection:

```typescript
function handleLanguageSelect() {
  // Language is already updated in the store by UnifiedLanguageModal
  // Just close the modal
  showLanguageModal.value = false
}
```

**Result:** Language selection now persists correctly in the header. When you select a language:
1. ‚úÖ Store updates
2. ‚úÖ `sessionStorage` flag set
3. ‚úÖ `localStorage` saves the language
4. ‚úÖ Selection persists across navigation
5. ‚úÖ No more reverting to English!

## Visual Improvements

### Before
- Grid columns: `minmax(140px, 1fr)`
- Padding: `1.25rem 1rem`
- Flag size: `2.5rem` (desktop), `2rem` (mobile)
- Min height: `44px`

### After
- Grid columns: `minmax(160px, 1fr)` (+14% wider)
- Padding: `1.5rem 1.25rem` (+20% more padding)
- Flag size: `3rem` (desktop) (+20%), `2.5rem` (mobile) (+25%)
- Min height: `100px` (+127% taller)

## Technical Details

### Language Persistence Flow (Fixed)

```
User clicks language in MobileHeader
         ‚Üì
UnifiedLanguageModal.selectLanguage()
         ‚Üì
trackSelection=true ‚Üí sessionStorage.setItem('userSelectedLanguage', 'true')
         ‚Üì
languageStore.setLanguage(language)
         ‚Üì
setLocale(language.code)
         ‚Üì
localStorage.setItem('userLocale', language.code)
         ‚Üì
Language persists! ‚úÖ
```

### Store Initialization Flow (Fixed)

```
useMobileLanguageStore() initializes
         ‚Üì
getInitialLanguage()
         ‚Üì
Check: sessionStorage.getItem('userSelectedLanguage') === 'true'
         ‚Üì
If TRUE:
  Read from localStorage ‚úÖ
  Return saved language ‚úÖ
         ‚Üì
If FALSE:
  Default to English (card will set original language)
```

**Key Insight:** The `sessionStorage` flag acts as a "user intentionally changed language" indicator. Without it, the store assumes you want the card's original language, not your saved preference.

## Related Components

- **`UnifiedLanguageModal.vue`** - Main language selector modal (used by both header and card overview)
- **`MobileHeader.vue`** - Header with language selector (content list, content detail pages)
- **`CardOverview.vue`** - Card overview with language selector (already had trackSelection=true)
- **`useMobileLanguageStore`** - Pinia store managing language state and persistence

## Developer Notes

### When to use `trackSelection`

- **`trackSelection={true}`**: Use when users are intentionally selecting their preferred language
  - User-facing language selectors ‚úÖ
  - Settings pages ‚úÖ
  - Navigation headers ‚úÖ

- **`trackSelection={false}`**: Use only for context-specific language changes
  - Preview modes
  - Temporary language switches
  - Admin/testing interfaces

**Rule of thumb:** If the user is choosing their language preference, always use `trackSelection={true}` to ensure proper persistence!

---

## Status

‚úÖ **Both issues completely fixed and tested!**

- Larger, more prominent language boxes
- English language selection bug resolved
- Proper persistence across all scenarios
- Consistent behavior between header and card overview
