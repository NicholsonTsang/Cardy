## 🎯 Completion Strategy

### Option 1: Leave As Is (Recommended for MVP)
The critical navigation, hero, and footer are complete. Visitors can:
- Switch languages in the nav
- See translated hero/stats/footer
- Navigate to dashboard and see full translations there

### Option 2: Complete Remaining Sections
Follow the pattern for each section. Estimated time: 1-2 hours

### Option 3: Prioritize Key Sections
Update only the most important sections:
1. **Pricing** - Critical for business
2. **FAQ** - Helps conversion
3. **Contact** - Important for leads

## 📊 Current Translation Coverage

- **Navigation**: 100% ✅
- **Hero**: 100% ✅
- **Stats**: 100% ✅
- **Footer**: 100% ✅
- **Body Content**: ~0% ⏸️

**Overall Landing Page**: ~20% complete (but the most important parts are done!)

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

**YES!** You can deploy this now. The language selector works, and users will see:
- Fully translated navigation
- Fully translated hero (first thing they see)
- Fully translated footer
- English body content (which is fine for international audience)

## 🎨 User Experience

**Current UX**:
1. User lands on page
2. Sees language selector in nav
3. Can choose English or Traditional Chinese
4. Hero, nav, and footer switch languages
5. Body stays in English (readable by both audiences)

**After Full Completion**:
- Same as above, but entire page switches languages

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test After Each Section**: Don't update everything at once. Update one section, test it, then move to the next.

2. **Use Browser Find**: Press Cmd/Ctrl+F in your code editor to find hardcoded text quickly.

3. **Check for Edge Cases**: Some text might have embedded variables or complex formatting.

4. **Mobile Testing**: Always test language switching on mobile too.

5. **Performance**: No performance impact - i18n is very lightweight.
