## 🚀 How to Deploy (Choose Your Path)

### Option 1: Production Deploy with HTTPS (Recommended)

**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Result:** Production-ready relay server with SSL

```bash
# 1. Read the quick deploy guide
cd openai-relay-server
cat DEPLOY_QUICK.md

# 2. SSH to your server
ssh user@your-server-ip

# 3. Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# 4. Upload files (git clone or rsync)
cd /opt && mkdir relay && cd relay
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git .
cd openai-relay-server

# 5. Configure environment
cat > .env << 'EOF'
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-production-key
NODE_ENV=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend-domain.com
EOF

# 6. Start service
docker-compose up -d

# 7. Set up HTTPS (Nginx + Let's Encrypt)
sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
# Configure Nginx (see DEPLOY_QUICK.md)
sudo certbot --nginx -d relay.your-domain.com

# 8. Verify deployment
./verify-deployment.sh
```

**Full guide:** [openai-relay-server/DEPLOY_QUICK.md](./openai-relay-server/DEPLOY_QUICK.md)

### Option 2: Local Development Testing

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Result:** Local relay for testing Realtime Mode

```bash
cd openai-relay-server

# 1. Configure
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add your OPENAI_API_KEY

# 2. Start
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Update frontend .env.local
echo "VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL=http://localhost:8080" >> ../.env.local

# 4. Test
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy",...}

# 5. Restart frontend
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Skip Relay (Use Chat Mode)

**Time:** 0 minutes (already works!)  
**Result:** No relay server needed

Chat Mode works without relay server:
- ✅ Voice recording (Whisper STT)
- ✅ Text input
- ✅ Streaming responses
- ✅ TTS voice output
- ✅ ~60x cheaper than Realtime Mode

**When to use Realtime Mode:**
- Need <1s latency voice conversations
- Natural bidirectional voice chat
- Real-time interruption support

**Most users should start with Chat Mode** and only deploy relay server if low-latency voice is essential.

## 🎯 Recommended Deployment Path

### Phase 1: Development (Now)
```bash
# Use Chat Mode (no relay needed)
# Already working in your app!
```

### Phase 2: Testing Realtime (Optional)
```bash
# Deploy local relay for testing
cd openai-relay-server
docker-compose up -d
```

### Phase 3: Production (When Ready)
```bash
# Follow DEPLOY_QUICK.md
# 15 minutes to production HTTPS relay
```

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] **Server Access**: Ubuntu 20.04+ VPS with SSH
- [ ] **Domain Name**: e.g., `relay.your-domain.com`
- [ ] **DNS Configured**: A record pointing to server IP
- [ ] **OpenAI API Key**: From https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- [ ] **Frontend URL**: Known for CORS configuration
- [ ] **Documentation Read**: [DEPLOY_QUICK.md](./openai-relay-server/DEPLOY_QUICK.md)

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

After deployment, verify everything works:

### 1. Run Verification Script

```bash
# On server
cd /opt/relay
./verify-deployment.sh
```

Expected: All checks pass (green ✓)

### 2. Test Health Endpoint

```bash
# From server
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# From internet
curl https://relay.your-domain.com/health

# Expected response
{"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","uptime":123.456,"version":"1.0.0"}
```

### 3. Test Frontend Integration

1. Update frontend environment:
   ```bash
   VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL=https://relay.your-domain.com
   ```

2. Rebuild and redeploy frontend

3. Test in app:
   - Open AI Assistant
   - Switch to "Live Call" mode
   - Start speaking
   - Verify: No CORS errors, voice works

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-production-key

# Server
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080

# Security (IMPORTANT!)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-frontend.com
# ⚠️ Never use * in production!
```

### Frontend

**File:** `.env` or production environment

```bash
# Required for Realtime Mode
VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL=https://relay.your-domain.com

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Symptom | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Container not starting** | `docker ps` shows nothing | Check `.env` has `OPENAI_API_KEY`, check logs |
| **CORS errors** | Browser console shows CORS | Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `.env` to exact domain |
| **Health check failing** | Container shows "unhealthy" | Wait 30s for startup, check logs |
| **Frontend can't connect** | Realtime mode fails | Verify `VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL` is correct |
| **SSL not working** | HTTPS fails | Run `sudo certbot --nginx -d relay.your-domain.com` |

## 📊 Architecture Overview

```
User Browser (Frontend)
         ↓
    [VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL]
         ↓
Nginx (Port 443 - HTTPS)
    SSL Termination
         ↓
Docker Container (Port 8080)
    Express.js Relay Server
    - CORS validation
    - Rate limiting
    - Health checks
         ↓
OpenAI Realtime API
    rtc.openai.com
```

**Why relay is needed:** OpenAI's Realtime API blocks direct browser connections due to CORS restrictions.

---

## 💰 Cost Estimate

### Infrastructure (Monthly)
- **VPS Server**: $5-10 (DigitalOcean, Vultr, Hetzner)
- **Domain**: $1-2/month (amortized)
- **SSL Certificate**: Free (Let's Encrypt)

**Total:** ~$6-12/month

### API Costs (Usage-based)
- **Realtime Mode**: $0.06-0.24 per minute
- **Chat Mode**: $0.001-0.01 per conversation

**Recommendation:** Start with Chat Mode (60x cheaper) for most users. Deploy relay only when low-latency voice is essential.
