# Landing Page Double Header Fix

## Issue

When logged in and viewing the landing page, scrolling down would reveal the dashboard header appearing underneath the landing page header. This was causing a confusing double-header effect.

## Root Cause

The landing page route was wrapped in the `AppLayout` component, which contains its own header with `mode="dashboard"`. The `LandingPage.vue` component also has its own header with `mode="landing"`. This resulted in **two headers being rendered simultaneously**:

### Before (Problematic Structure):

```
AppLayout (with dashboard header - sticky)
  └─ LandingPage (with landing header - fixed)
```

**What happened**:
1. Both headers rendered at the same position (top: 0)
2. Both had the same z-index (50)
3. The fixed landing header appeared on top initially
4. When scrolling, the sticky dashboard header stayed at the top and became visible underneath
5. User saw the dashboard header "appearing" when scrolling down

### Route Configuration (Before):
```javascript
{
  path: '/',
  component: AppLayout,  // ← Wraps with dashboard header
  children: [
    {
      path: '',
      name: 'landing',
      component: () => import('@/views/Public/LandingPage.vue')  // ← Has its own header
    }
  ]
}
```

## Solution

Made the landing page a **standalone route** without the `AppLayout` wrapper. The `LandingPage.vue` component already has its own `UnifiedHeader` with `mode="landing"`, so it doesn't need the layout wrapper.

### After (Correct Structure):

```
LandingPage (with landing header only - fixed)
```

**What happens now**:
1. Only ONE header renders (landing mode)
2. No layout wrapper
3. No dashboard header present
4. Clean, consistent experience when scrolling

### Route Configuration (After):
```javascript
{
  path: '/',
  name: 'landing',
  component: () => import('@/views/Public/LandingPage.vue')  // ← Standalone, no wrapper
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Router Configuration (`src/router/index.ts`)

**Before**:
```javascript
{
  path: '/',
  component: AppLayout,
  children: [
    {
      path: '',
      name: 'landing',
      component: () => import('@/views/Public/LandingPage.vue')
    }
  ]
},
```

**After**:
```javascript
{
  path: '/',
  name: 'landing',
  component: () => import('@/views/Public/LandingPage.vue')
},
```

### 2. Mobile Menu Position (`src/views/Public/LandingPage.vue`)

Fixed the mobile menu dropdown to align with the header height:

**Before**: `top-20` (80px - incorrect)
**After**: `top-16` (64px - matches header height)

## Why This Makes Sense

### Landing Page Should Be Standalone

The landing page is a **public-facing marketing page** that should be:
- Independent from the dashboard
- Accessible to unauthenticated users
- Have its own dedicated header with landing-specific content (About, Demo, Pricing, Contact)
- Not wrapped in dashboard layout

### Other Routes Correctly Use AppLayout

Routes that SHOULD use `AppLayout`:
- ✅ `/cms/*` - Dashboard pages (requires auth)
- ✅ `/login` - Sign in page (needs consistent branding)
- ✅ `/signup` - Sign up page (needs consistent branding)
- ✅ `/reset-password` - Password reset (needs consistent branding)

Routes that should NOT use AppLayout:
- ✅ `/` - Landing page (has its own header)
- ✅ `/c/:issue_card_id` - Public card view (mobile-optimized)
- ✅ `/preview/:card_id` - Card preview (mobile-optimized)

## Testing

### Before Fix:
1. Log in to the site
2. Navigate to `/` (landing page)
3. Scroll down
4. ❌ Dashboard header appears underneath

### After Fix:
1. Log in to the site
2. Navigate to `/` (landing page)
3. Scroll down
4. ✅ Only landing header visible, no dashboard header

### Test Cases

#### Unauthenticated User:
- ✅ Landing page displays correctly
- ✅ Header shows: About, Demo, Pricing, Contact, Language, Sign In, Sign Up
- ✅ No dashboard header
- ✅ Scrolling works normally

#### Authenticated User (Card Issuer):
- ✅ Landing page displays correctly
- ✅ Header shows: About, Demo, Pricing, Contact, Language, User Menu
- ✅ No dashboard header
- ✅ Scrolling works normally
- ✅ Can access dashboard via user menu

#### Authenticated User (Admin):
- ✅ Landing page displays correctly
- ✅ Header shows: About, Demo, Pricing, Contact, Language, User Menu
- ✅ No dashboard header
- ✅ Scrolling works normally
- ✅ Can access admin panel via user menu

## Benefits

### 1. **Clean User Experience**
- No confusing double headers
- Consistent appearance when scrolling
- Professional presentation

### 2. **Correct Architecture**
- Landing page is truly standalone
- Clear separation: public pages vs. dashboard
- Follows single responsibility principle

### 3. **Better Performance**
- One less component in the render tree
- Simpler DOM structure
- Faster initial load

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Clearer component hierarchy
- Easier to understand and debug
- Prevents future confusion

## Related Components

### Components NOT Affected:
- ✅ Dashboard pages (`/cms/*`) - Still use AppLayout
- ✅ Auth pages (login/signup) - Still use AppLayout
- ✅ Mobile card view - Already standalone
- ✅ UnifiedHeader component - No changes needed

### Components Fixed:
- ✅ Landing page route - Removed layout wrapper
- ✅ Mobile menu positioning - Updated to match header height

## Future Considerations

### Layout Strategy

This fix establishes a clear pattern:

**Use AppLayout for**:
- Dashboard pages (card management)
- Admin pages
- Authentication pages (login, signup, password reset)
- Any page that needs the dashboard header with user menu

**Don't use AppLayout for**:
- Landing/marketing pages
- Public card views
- Mobile-optimized pages
- Pages with their own header design

### Adding New Pages

When adding new pages, ask:
- Does this page need the dashboard header? → Use AppLayout
- Is this a public/marketing page? → Standalone, no layout
- Is this mobile-optimized? → Standalone, no layout

## Summary

The landing page now correctly renders as a standalone component without the `AppLayout` wrapper, eliminating the double-header issue. This provides a cleaner user experience, better architecture, and prevents confusion when logged-in users view the landing page.

**Before**: Two headers rendered → Dashboard header visible on scroll
**After**: One header rendered → Clean, consistent experience

✅ Issue resolved
✅ No breaking changes
✅ Better architecture
✅ Cleaner code
