## 🎯 Recommendations

### Further Cleanup Opportunities

1. **Check Edge Function Usage**
   ```bash
   # Search for imports of get-openai-ephemeral-token
   grep -r "get-openai-ephemeral-token" src
   ```
   - If not used, can be removed
   - `openai-realtime-relay` has replaced it

2. **Consider Refactoring** (Optional)
   - See `AI_ASSISTANT_REFACTORING_PLAN.md`
   - Break down 75 KB file into smaller components
   - Estimated effort: 8-12 hours

3. **Remove Old Documentation** (If Any)
   - Check for outdated `.md` files related to old implementations
   - Keep only current documentation
