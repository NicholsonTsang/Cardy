# Password Reset Fix - Summary

## Issue Reported
User reported: "Seems current forget password at login page, the supabase link sent me is not routing to reset password page"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Missing Auth State Handler
The application was not listening for the `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` auth event from Supabase. When users clicked the reset link in their email, Supabase would redirect them with the password recovery token, but the app had no handler to navigate them to the reset password page.

### Problem 2: Missing Redirect URL Configuration
Even if the auth state handler existed, Supabase requires redirect URLs to be explicitly whitelisted in the dashboard. Without this configuration, Supabase won't redirect users to the reset password page.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Password Recovery Event Handler
**File**: `src/stores/auth.ts`

Added automatic redirect when password recovery event is detected:

```typescript
if (event === 'PASSWORD_RECOVERY') {
  console.log('Password recovery event detected, redirecting to reset-password page')
  router.push('/reset-password')
}
```

This ensures that when a user clicks the reset link in their email, they are automatically navigated to the reset password page.

### 2. Documented Configuration Requirements
**File**: `.env.example`

Added clear documentation about the required Supabase configuration:

```
# Auth Redirect URLs (must be configured in Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > URL Configuration)
# Add these URLs to "Redirect URLs" whitelist:
# - http://localhost:5173/reset-password (for local development)
# - https://your-production-domain.com/reset-password (for production)
```

### 3. Updated Project Documentation
**Files**: `CLAUDE.md`, `PASSWORD_RESET_FIX.md`, `DEPLOY_PASSWORD_RESET_FIX.md`

- Added to common issues section in CLAUDE.md
- Created comprehensive technical documentation
- Created quick deployment guide

## How It Works Now

### Complete Flow

1. **User initiates reset**: Clicks "Forgot Password?" on login page
2. **Email sent**: Frontend calls `authStore.sendPasswordResetEmail(email)` with redirect URL
3. **Email received**: User receives email with reset link from Supabase
4. **Link clicked**: User clicks link, Supabase validates and redirects to app
5. **Redirect**: Supabase redirects to `https://your-app.com/reset-password#access_token=...&type=recovery`
6. **Event fires**: `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` auth state change event is triggered
7. **Auto-navigate**: App automatically navigates to `/reset-password` page
8. **Validation**: ResetPassword component validates the access token from URL hash
9. **Password update**: User enters new password, calls `authStore.updatePassword()`
10. **Complete**: Password updated, user redirected to login page

### Technical Implementation

**Email Request:**
```typescript
const redirectUrl = `${window.location.origin}/reset-password`
await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email_value, {
  redirectTo: redirectUrl
})
```

**Supabase Email Link:**
```
https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/verify?
  token=xxx&
  type=recovery&
  redirect_to=https://your-app.com/reset-password
```

**After Redirect:**
```
https://your-app.com/reset-password#
  access_token=xxx&
  expires_in=3600&
  refresh_token=xxx&
  token_type=bearer&
  type=recovery
```

**Auth State Handler:**
```typescript
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, newSession) => {
  if (event === 'PASSWORD_RECOVERY') {
    router.push('/reset-password')
  }
})
```

## Required Configuration (CRITICAL)

### Supabase Dashboard Setup

**You MUST do this for password reset to work:**

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
2. Find **Redirect URLs** section
3. Add these URLs:

```
http://localhost:5173/reset-password
https://your-production-domain.com/reset-password
```

Without this configuration, Supabase will reject the redirect and users will not reach the reset password page.

## Testing Checklist

### Local Testing
- [ ] Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Navigate to login page
- [ ] Click "Forgot Password?"
- [ ] Enter email and submit
- [ ] Check email inbox
- [ ] Click reset link in email
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/reset-password` page
- [ ] Enter new password
- [ ] Verify password updates successfully
- [ ] Verify redirect to login page
- [ ] Login with new password

### Production Testing
- [ ] Deploy code to production
- [ ] Add production domain to Supabase redirect URLs
- [ ] Test full flow on production domain
- [ ] Verify email delivery
- [ ] Verify redirect works
- [ ] Verify password update works

## Security Features

- ✅ Reset links expire after 1 hour (Supabase default)
- ✅ Access tokens are one-time use
- ✅ Password requirements enforced (6+ characters)
- ✅ Links invalidated after successful reset
- ✅ No authentication required to access reset page (by design)
- ✅ Token validation on page load
- ✅ Error handling for invalid/expired tokens

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Deploy

```bash
# 1. Commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Password reset redirect flow"
git push

# 2. Configure Supabase (MUST DO IN DASHBOARD)
# - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > URL Configuration
# - Add redirect URLs (see DEPLOY_PASSWORD_RESET_FIX.md)

# 3. Test the flow
# - Local: http://localhost:5173/login
# - Production: https://your-domain.com/login
```
