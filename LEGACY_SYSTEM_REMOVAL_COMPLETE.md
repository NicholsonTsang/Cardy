# ✅ Legacy Batch Payment System Removed

**Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Action**: Complete removal of unused legacy batch payment system

---

## 🔍 What Was Removed

### System Overview
The **legacy direct Stripe checkout system** for batch payments was completely removed. This system allowed users to:
1. Create a batch
2. Redirect to Stripe checkout
3. Pay for the batch
4. Return to confirm payment

This has been **superseded by the credit system** where users:
1. Purchase credits upfront
2. Use credits to instantly issue batches
3. No Stripe redirect needed

## 🗑️ Files Deleted

### 1. Edge Functions (2 files)
- ❌ `/supabase/functions/create-checkout-session/index.ts`
- ❌ `/supabase/functions/handle-checkout-success/index.ts`

### 2. Stored Procedures (1 file, 6 functions)
- ❌ `/sql/storeproc/client-side/06_payment_management.sql`
  - `create_batch_checkout_payment()`
  - `get_batch_for_checkout()`
  - `get_existing_batch_payment()`
  - `confirm_batch_payment_by_session()`
  - `create_pending_batch_payment()`
  - `confirm_pending_batch_payment()`

### 3. Frontend Functions (4 functions from stripeCheckout.js)
- ❌ `createCheckoutSession()`
- ❌ `handleCheckoutSuccess()`
- ❌ `calculatePaymentAmount()`
- ❌ `calculateBatchCost()`

**Kept**: `formatAmount()` - Still used by credit system

## ✅ What Was NOT Removed (Still in Use)

### Database Tables
- ✅ **`batch_payments` table** - Keep for audit trail and webhook references
- ✅ **`card_batches` table** - Core functionality

### Credit System Edge Functions
- ✅ `create-credit-checkout-session` - Active
- ✅ `handle-credit-purchase-success` - Active  
- ✅ `stripe-credit-webhook` - Active

### Frontend
- ✅ `CardIssuanceCheckout.vue` - Uses credit system
- ✅ `stripeCheckout.js` - Credit functions retained
- ✅ `useCreditStore()` - Active

## 📊 Before vs After

| Aspect | Legacy System (Removed) | Current System (Active) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Payment Flow** | Create batch → Stripe → Confirm | Buy credits → Instant batch |
| **User Experience** | Redirect to Stripe | No redirect |
| **Batch Creation** | After payment | Instant (credit consumption) |
| **Edge Functions** | 2 (create/handle-checkout) | 1 (credit checkout) |
| **Stored Procedures** | 6 batch payment functions | 1 (issue_card_batch_with_credits) |
| **Status** | ❌ Deleted | ✅ Active |

---

## 🔍 Verification

### Confirmed No Usage
```bash
# No frontend references
$ grep -r "createCheckoutSession\|handleCheckoutSuccess" src/
# Result: No matches ✅

# Credit system is used instead  
$ grep -r "issueBatchWithCredits" src/
# Result: Found in CardIssuanceCheckout.vue ✅
```

### Pattern Consistency
After this removal, all payment-related Edge Functions now use **SERVICE_ROLE_KEY**:
- ✅ `create-credit-checkout-session` - SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- ✅ `stripe-credit-webhook` - SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- ✅ `translate-card-content` - SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

**No more ANON_KEY pattern inconsistencies!** 🎉

## 🚀 Deployment Required

### Step 1: Deploy Database Changes

Run in [Supabase SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mzgusshseqxrdrkvamrg/sql):

```sql
-- Copy and paste DEPLOY_REMOVE_LEGACY_BATCH_PAYMENT.sql
-- This drops the 6 legacy stored procedures
```

### Step 2: Verify Edge Functions (Optional)

List deployed Edge Functions:
```bash
npx supabase functions list
```

**Expected**: Should NOT see:
- ❌ `create-checkout-session`
- ❌ `handle-checkout-success`

**Should see**:
- ✅ `create-credit-checkout-session`
- ✅ `handle-credit-purchase-success`
- ✅ `stripe-credit-webhook`
- ✅ `translate-card-content`

If old functions still deployed:
```bash
npx supabase functions delete create-checkout-session
npx supabase functions delete handle-checkout-success
```
