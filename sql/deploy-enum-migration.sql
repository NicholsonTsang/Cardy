-- Run this script to update your database

BEGIN;

-- Step 1: Add the new SHIPPING value to the existing enum
ALTER TYPE "PrintRequestStatus" ADD VALUE 'SHIPPING';

-- Step 2: Update all existing records to use SHIPPING consistently
UPDATE print_requests 
SET status = 'SHIPPING' 
WHERE status = 'SHIPPED';

-- Step 3: Update the stored procedure to use SHIPPING
