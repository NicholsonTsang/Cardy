## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Language switcher not showing

**Solution:**
- Check `src/components/Layout/AppHeader.vue` for `<LanguageSwitcher />`
- Verify import is correct
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Translations not working

**Solution:**
- Verify `app.use(i18n)` in `src/main.ts`
- Check locale file syntax (valid JSON)
- Clear browser cache and localStorage
- Check browser console for missing key warnings

### Issue: Language not persisting

**Solution:**
- Check localStorage in browser DevTools
- Look for `userLocale` key
- Verify `setLocale()` function is called
- Check for localStorage errors in console

### Issue: Text showing translation keys instead of text

**Solution:**
- Verify translation key exists in locale file
- Check spelling of key
- Ensure locale file is valid JSON
- Check fallback locale is set correctly

### Issue: Arabic not displaying RTL

**Solution:**
- Verify `setLocale('ar')` is called
- Check `document.documentElement.getAttribute('dir')`
- Should be `"rtl"` for Arabic
- Check CSS for RTL overrides if needed
