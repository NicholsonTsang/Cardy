**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Component**: CardIssuanceCheckout.vue

---

## Issue

Missing Traditional Chinese (zh-Hant) translations for batch checkout dialog, causing i18n fallback warnings:

```
[intlify] Not found 'batches.order_physical_cards' key in 'zh' locale messages.
[intlify] Not found 'batches.print_request_description' key in 'zh' locale messages.
[intlify] Not found 'batches.good_to_know' key in 'zh' locale messages.
[intlify] Not found 'batches.cards_active_immediately' key in 'zh' locale messages.
[intlify] Not found 'batches.download_qr_anytime' key in 'zh' locale messages.
[intlify] Not found 'batches.print_request_optional' key in 'zh' locale messages.
```

## Keys Added

Added 6 missing translation keys to `src/i18n/locales/zh-Hant.json`:

| Key | English | Traditional Chinese (zh-Hant) |
|-----|---------|------------------------------|
| `order_physical_cards` | Order Physical Cards | 訂購實體卡片 |
| `print_request_description` | Request professional printing & shipping | 申請專業印刷及運送服務 |
| `good_to_know` | Good to Know | 溫馨提示 |
| `cards_active_immediately` | All cards are active and scannable immediately | 所有卡片立即啟用並可掃描 |
| `download_qr_anytime` | You can download QR codes anytime from the batch view | 您可以隨時從批次檢視下載二維碼 |
| `print_request_optional` | Physical card printing is optional - digital cards work independently | 實體卡片印刷為可選項目 - 數位卡片可獨立運作 |

## Changes Made

**File**: `src/i18n/locales/zh-Hant.json` (lines 386-391)

```json
{
  "batches": {
    ...
    "order_physical_cards": "訂購實體卡片",
    "print_request_description": "申請專業印刷及運送服務",
    "good_to_know": "溫馨提示",
    "cards_active_immediately": "所有卡片立即啟用並可掃描",
    "download_qr_anytime": "您可以隨時從批次檢視下載二維碼",
    "print_request_optional": "實體卡片印刷為可選項目 - 數位卡片可獨立運作"
  }
}
```

---

## Context

These keys are used in the batch issuance checkout dialog to inform users about:
1. Physical card printing options
2. Digital card immediate availability
3. QR code download functionality

The section appears after credit confirmation and before batch creation success.

---

## Testing

✅ No linter errors  
✅ JSON syntax valid  
✅ All keys properly formatted  
⏳ Manual browser testing (switch to Traditional Chinese language)

### Test Steps
1. Navigate to card batch issuance
2. Switch language to Traditional Chinese (zh-Hant)
3. Open batch creation dialog
4. Verify all text displays correctly without fallback warnings
5. Check "Good to Know" section renders properly

## Notes

### Translation Approach
- **"Good to Know"** → **"溫馨提示"** (Warm reminder/tip)
  - More natural in Chinese context than literal "知道很好"
  - Commonly used in Chinese UX for helpful information

- **"Order Physical Cards"** → **"訂購實體卡片"**
  - Clear distinction between physical (實體) and digital (數位)

- **"Optional"** → **"可選項目"**
  - Emphasizes user choice

### Consistency
All translations follow existing patterns in the zh-Hant locale:
- Formal/professional tone for business users
- Clear technical terminology
- Traditional Chinese characters (not Simplified)

---

## Impact

- ✅ Removes 6 console warnings
- ✅ Improves Traditional Chinese user experience
- ✅ Maintains consistency across active languages (en, zh-Hant)
- ✅ No breaking changes
