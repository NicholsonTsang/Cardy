# Admin QR & Access Tab Fix

## 🐛 **Issue**

**Problem:**
The QR & Access tab in the Admin User Cards Viewer was not showing any batches or QR codes when viewing other users' cards.

**Root Cause:**
The `get_card_batches` and `get_issued_cards_with_batch` functions were filtering results to only show batches for cards owned by the currently authenticated user (`WHERE c.user_id = auth.uid()`), which excluded admin users viewing other users' cards.

---

## 🔍 **Problem Analysis**

### **Original Logic:**

```sql
-- ❌ Only allows card owner
WHERE ic.card_id = p_card_id AND c.user_id = auth.uid()
```

**Issue:** 
- Card Issuer viewing their own cards: ✅ Works
- Admin viewing other users' cards: ❌ No data returned

---

## ✅ **Solution**

### **Updated Logic:**

```sql
-- ✅ Allows card owner OR admin
WHERE ic.card_id = p_card_id 
  AND (c.user_id = auth.uid() OR v_caller_role = 'admin')
```

**Authorization Now Allows:**
1. **Card Owner** - User who created the card
2. **Admin** - Any user with role = 'admin'

---

## 📋 **Functions Updated (2)**

### **1. `get_card_batches(p_card_id UUID)`**

**Purpose:** Returns all card batches for a specific card

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `v_caller_role TEXT` variable
- ✅ Query caller's role from `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data`
- ✅ Updated WHERE clause to allow admin access
- ✅ Added comment explaining admin access

**Location:** `sql/storeproc/client-side/04_batch_management.sql` (lines 100-163)

**Before:**
```sql
WHERE cb.card_id = p_card_id AND c.user_id = auth.uid()
```

**After:**
```sql
WHERE cb.card_id = p_card_id 
  AND (c.user_id = auth.uid() OR v_caller_role = 'admin')
```

---

### **2. `get_issued_cards_with_batch(p_card_id UUID)`**

**Purpose:** Returns all issued cards for a specific card with batch information

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `v_caller_role TEXT` variable
- ✅ Query caller's role from `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data`
- ✅ Updated WHERE clause to allow admin access
- ✅ Added comment explaining admin access

**Location:** `sql/storeproc/client-side/04_batch_management.sql` (lines 166-207)

**Before:**
```sql
WHERE ic.card_id = p_card_id AND c.user_id = auth.uid()
```

**After:**
```sql
WHERE ic.card_id = p_card_id 
  AND (c.user_id = auth.uid() OR v_caller_role = 'admin')
```

## 🔐 **Authorization Matrix**

| User Type | Owns Card | Can View QR Codes? | Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| **Card Owner** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Owner access |
| **Card Owner** | ❌ No | ❌ No | Not authorized |
| **Admin** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Owner + admin access |
| **Admin** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | Admin privilege ✨ **NEW** |
| **Regular User** | ❌ No | ❌ No | Not authorized |

---

## 🎨 **Security Considerations**

### **Why This is Safe:**

1. **Read-Only Access** - Functions only return data, no write operations
2. **Admin Role Required** - Only users with explicit admin role can access
3. **Authentication Required** - `auth.uid()` must be valid
4. **Card Existence Check** - Validates card exists before access
5. **Consistent Pattern** - Same role check used across all admin functions

### **What Admins CAN Do:**
- ✅ View batches and issued cards
- ✅ See QR codes
- ✅ Copy URLs
- ✅ Download QR codes and CSV
- ✅ Open cards for testing

### **What Admins CANNOT Do:**
- ❌ Edit batches
- ❌ Create new batches
- ❌ Delete issued cards
- ❌ Activate/deactivate cards
- ❌ Modify QR codes
- ❌ Change card ownership

**Result:** Safe, read-only access for support purposes ✅
