# Outdated Code Cleanup - Complete ✅

## 🗑️ Files Deleted

### Frontend Files

1. ✅ **`src/views/MobileClient/components/MobileAIAssistantRevised.vue`**
   - **Size**: ~24 KB
   - **Reason**: Outdated version, not imported anywhere
   - **Replaced by**: Current `MobileAIAssistant.vue`

2. ✅ **`src/utils/http.js`**
   - **Size**: 148 lines
   - **Reason**: Unused utility file with outdated API references
   - **Status**: No imports found anywhere in codebase

### Edge Functions (Backend)

3. ✅ **`supabase/functions/get-openai-ephemeral-token/`**
   - **Reason**: Replaced by `openai-realtime-relay`
   - **Status**: Not used in current implementation

4. ✅ **`supabase/functions/openai-realtime-proxy/`**
   - **Reason**: Old WebRTC proxy approach (failed due to CORS)
   - **Replaced by**: WebSocket approach in `openai-realtime-relay`
   - **Status**: Only referenced in deleted `http.js`

## 🎯 What Was Removed & Why

### 1. MobileAIAssistantRevised.vue
**Why**: This was an experimental/draft version that never made it to production. The current `MobileAIAssistant.vue` contains the complete, working implementation with both chat-completion and realtime modes.

### 2. http.js
**Why**: This utility file was created for the old WebRTC approach that required an HTTP proxy for SDP exchange. The new WebSocket approach doesn't need this, and the file wasn't imported anywhere.

### 3. get-openai-ephemeral-token/
**Why**: This was a separate function just for token generation. It's been integrated into `openai-realtime-relay` which handles both token generation and session configuration in one call.

### 4. openai-realtime-proxy/
**Why**: This was the old approach that tried to proxy WebRTC SDP offers/answers via HTTP, which failed due to CORS. The new WebSocket approach connects directly without needing this proxy.

## 🏗️ Architecture Evolution

### Old Architecture (❌ Removed)
```
Frontend → http.js → openai-realtime-proxy (Edge Function)
                   → get-openai-ephemeral-token (Edge Function)
                   → OpenAI (HTTP POST - CORS error)
```

### New Architecture (✅ Current)
```
Frontend → openai-realtime-relay (Edge Function - token + config)
        → WebSocket → OpenAI Realtime API (wss://)
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No CORS issues
- ✅ Simpler architecture
- ✅ Fewer Edge Functions to maintain
- ✅ Direct WebSocket connection (lower latency)

- Keep both components
- Add feature flag or toggle
- Gather user feedback

**Option C: Gradual Rollout**
- Deploy as `MobileAIAssistantV2.vue`
