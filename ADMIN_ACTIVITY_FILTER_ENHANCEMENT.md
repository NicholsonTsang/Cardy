# Admin Activity Filter Enhancement

## Summary

Enhanced the Admin History Logs activity filter by adding **17 new activity types** that were being logged but missing from the filter dropdown. This allows admins to better filter and find specific types of operations in the system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Action Types Store (`src/stores/admin/auditLog.ts`)
**Added 17 new activity types**, organized by category:

#### User Management (5 types)
- ‚úÖ `USER_REGISTRATION` (existing)

- ‚úÖ `PRINT_REQUEST_UPDATE` (existing)
- ‚úÖ `PRINT_REQUEST_WITHDRAWAL` (existing)

**Total**: 28 activity types (11 existing + 17 new)

### 2. Updated History Logs Component (`src/views/Dashboard/Admin/HistoryLogs.vue`)

#### Filter Dropdown
- Added all 28 activity types to the filter dropdown
- Organized by category with comments
- Converted from hardcoded array to computed property for i18n support
- Uses translation keys: `admin.activity_types.*`

#### Visual Styling (Colors & Icons)
Added distinctive colors and icons for all activity types:

### 3. Internationalization

#### English (`src/i18n/locales/en.json`)
Added `admin.activity_types` object with all 24 activity type labels:
```json
"activity_types": {
  "all_activities": "All Activities",
  "credit_adjustments": "Credit Adjustments",
  "credit_purchases": "Credit Purchases",
  "credit_consumption": "Credit Consumption",
  // ... (21 more)
}
```

#### Traditional Chinese (`src/i18n/locales/zh-Hant.json`)
Added complete Traditional Chinese translations:
```json
"activity_types": {
  "all_activities": "ÊâÄÊúâÊ¥ªÂãï",
  "credit_adjustments": "ÈªûÊï∏Ë™øÊï¥",
  "credit_purchases": "ÈªûÊï∏Ë≥ºË≤∑",
  "credit_consumption": "ÈªûÊï∏Ê∂àË≤ª",
  // ... (21 more)
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Credit adjustment events appear in History Logs
- [ ] Filter dropdown shows all 28 activity types
- [ ] Filter by "Credit Adjustments" shows only credit adjustment events
- [ ] Credit adjustment events have amber background with dollar icon
- [ ] All new filter options work correctly
- [ ] Translations work in both English and Traditional Chinese
- [ ] Icons and colors are visually distinct and appropriate

## Impact

### Benefits
1. **Better Filtering**: Admins can now filter by specific operation types including credit adjustments
2. **Visual Clarity**: Each activity type has distinctive color and icon for quick identification
3. **Complete Coverage**: All logged operations now have corresponding filter options
4. **Organized Structure**: Activities grouped by category (User, Card, Content, Batch, Credit, Print)
5. **Internationalization**: Full support for English and Traditional Chinese

### User Experience
- **Before**: Only 11 filter options, many operations couldn't be filtered
- **After**: 28 comprehensive filter options covering all logged operations
- **Credit Adjustments**: Now easily filterable and visually identifiable with amber/dollar styling

## Operations Now Filterable

Previously missing operations now filterable:
1. ‚úÖ Credit adjustments (admin manually adjusting user credits)
2. ‚úÖ Credit purchases (users buying credits)
3. ‚úÖ Credit consumption (credits spent on translations/batches)
4. ‚úÖ Content item creation/updates/deletions
5. ‚úÖ Card activations
6. ‚úÖ Batch issuance (regular and free)
7. ‚úÖ Print request submissions
8. ‚úÖ Verification resets and manual approvals

## Files Modified

1. `src/stores/admin/auditLog.ts` - Added 17 new ACTION_TYPES constants + search keyword mapping
2. `src/views/Dashboard/Admin/HistoryLogs.vue` - Updated filter dropdown, icons, colors, and i18n
3. `src/i18n/locales/en.json` - Added activity type translations
4. `src/i18n/locales/zh-Hant.json` - Added Traditional Chinese translations

## Technical Details: Action Type ‚Üí Search Keyword Mapping

### The Problem
The stored procedure `get_operations_log` searches operation text using `ILIKE`, but:
- **Filter sends**: ACTION_TYPE constants like `"CREDIT_ADJUSTMENT"`
- **Logs contain**: Descriptive text like `"Admin adjusted credits for user..."`
- **Result**: No matches found! ‚ùå

### The Solution
Created `ACTION_TYPE_SEARCH_KEYWORDS` mapping to convert UI constants to actual log text:

```typescript
export const ACTION_TYPE_SEARCH_KEYWORDS: Record<string, string> = {
  CREDIT_ADJUSTMENT: 'Admin adjusted credits',  // Matches actual log text
  CREDIT_PURCHASE: 'Credit purchase',
  CREDIT_CONSUMPTION: 'Credit consumption',
  CARD_CREATION: 'Created card:',
  // ... etc
}
```

When filtering:
1. User selects "Credit Adjustments" from dropdown
2. Frontend sends `action_type: 'CREDIT_ADJUSTMENT'`
3. Store maps it to `'Admin adjusted credits'` via `ACTION_TYPE_SEARCH_KEYWORDS`
4. Stored procedure searches for `'Admin adjusted credits'` in operation text
5. ‚úÖ Matches found!

### Example Mappings
| Action Type | Search Keyword | Matches Log Text |
|------------|----------------|------------------|
| `CREDIT_ADJUSTMENT` | `'Admin adjusted credits'` | "Admin adjusted credits for user..." |
| `CREDIT_PURCHASE` | `'Credit purchase'` | "Credit purchase initiated: 100 credits..." |
| `CARD_CREATION` | `'Created card:'` | "Created card: Museum Tour" |
| `CARD_ACTIVATION` | `'activated'` | "Activated issued card" / "Card auto-activated" |
| `FREE_BATCH_ISSUANCE` | `'Admin issued free batch'` | "Admin issued free batch: ..." |

## Notes

- No database changes required - all operations already being logged
- No breaking changes - purely additive enhancements
- Follows existing design patterns and conventions
- All linter checks pass
- ‚úÖ **Filtering now works correctly** with keyword mapping
