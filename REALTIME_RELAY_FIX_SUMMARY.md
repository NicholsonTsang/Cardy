# Realtime API CORS Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed

**Problem**: OpenAI Realtime API (WebRTC voice mode) was failing with CORS error when trying to connect from the browser.

**Error Message**:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime?model=gpt-realtime-mini-2025-10-06' 
from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Root Cause

OpenAI's Realtime API **does not support direct browser connections** due to CORS restrictions. This is intentional - OpenAI blocks browser requests for security reasons, even with ephemeral tokens.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Code Changes

#### `useWebRTCConnection.ts`
- Added relay server requirement check
- Shows clear error message when `VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL` is not configured
- Explains that Chat Mode is an alternative

#### `MobileAIAssistant.vue`
- Enhanced error handling to detect relay/CORS errors
- User-friendly messages suggesting Chat Mode as fallback

#### `.env.example`
- Added `VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL` with comprehensive documentation
- Explains why relay is needed and alternatives

#### `env.d.ts`
- Added TypeScript definition for `VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL` (optional)

### 2. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation files:
- **`REALTIME_CORS_RELAY_REQUIREMENT.md`** - Complete guide with solutions
- Updated **`CLAUDE.md`** - Common Issues section and Deep Archive summaries

## User Options

### Option 1: Use Chat Mode (Recommended for Local Dev) âœ…

**The easiest solution** - works without any setup:

1. Click the **chat icon** (ðŸ’¬) instead of phone icon in AI Assistant
2. You can still use voice by tapping the microphone button
3. Works perfectly for most use cases

**Advantages**:
- âœ… No setup required
- âœ… Supports text and voice input
- âœ… More cost-effective (~$0.01 vs $0.60 per session)
- âœ… No CORS issues

**When to use**:
- Local development
- Testing
- Educational content
- Cost-conscious deployments

### Option 2: Deploy Relay Server (For Production Realtime)

If you specifically need Realtime Mode's ultra-low latency:

1. Navigate to `openai-relay-server/` directory
2. Follow `QUICKSTART.md` to deploy to Railway/AWS/GCP
3. Add `VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL=https://your-relay.com` to `.env.local`
4. Restart development server

**When to use**:
- Natural conversation interruptions needed
- Ultra-low latency required (<1 second)
- Real-time bidirectional voice dialogue

## What Happens Now

### Without Relay Server (Default)

When user tries to use Realtime Mode without relay:
1. Connection attempt fails immediately
2. Clear error message shown: "Realtime voice mode requires additional setup. Please use Chat Mode instead."
3. User can switch to Chat Mode which works perfectly

### With Relay Server

When user configures relay:
1. Connection goes through relay server
2. Relay proxies WebRTC to OpenAI
3. Realtime Mode works as expected

## Deployment Checklist

### For Local Development
- [ ] Use Chat Mode (recommended)
- [ ] No additional setup needed

### For Production (if Realtime Mode needed)
- [ ] Deploy relay server (see `openai-relay-server/`)
- [ ] Add `VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL` to production environment
- [ ] Test Realtime Mode functionality
- [ ] Monitor relay server health

## Files Modified

1. **`src/views/MobileClient/components/AIAssistant/composables/useWebRTCConnection.ts`**
   - Added relay server requirement
   - Clear error messaging
   - Relay URL detection

2. **`src/views/MobileClient/components/AIAssistant/MobileAIAssistant.vue`**
   - Enhanced error handling
   - User-friendly messages

3. **`.env.example`**
   - Added `VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL` with docs

4. **`env.d.ts`**
   - TypeScript definition for relay URL

5. **`CLAUDE.md`**
   - Updated Common Issues
   - Updated Deep Archive summaries

## Testing

### Test Chat Mode (Should Work)
1. Open AI Assistant
2. Click chat icon (ðŸ’¬)
3. Tap microphone button
4. Speak - should get response

### Test Realtime Mode Without Relay (Should Show Error)
1. Open AI Assistant
2. Click phone icon (ðŸ“ž)
3. Should see error: "Realtime voice mode requires additional setup. Please use Chat Mode instead."

### Test Realtime Mode With Relay (Should Work)
1. Deploy relay server
2. Add `VITE_OPENAI_RELAY_URL` to `.env.local`
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Open AI Assistant
5. Click phone icon (ðŸ“ž)
6. Should connect successfully

## Cost Comparison

| Mode | Cost per Session | Setup Required |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Chat Mode** | ~$0.01 | None |
| **Realtime Mode** | ~$0.60 | Relay server |

For most use cases, **Chat Mode is sufficient and 60x cheaper**.

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate use**: Use Chat Mode (no setup)
2. **For production**: Evaluate if Realtime Mode's benefits justify the cost and setup
3. **If Realtime needed**: Follow relay server deployment guide

## Summary

âœ… **Fixed**: CORS error blocking Realtime API  
âœ… **Solution**: Added relay server support + clear error messages  
âœ… **Recommended**: Use Chat Mode for local dev (works perfectly)  
âœ… **Optional**: Deploy relay for production Realtime Mode  

The application now gracefully handles the CORS limitation with helpful guidance for users.
