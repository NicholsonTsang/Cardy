## Session-Based Billing

Starter and Premium plans use session-based billing where you pay per visitor session from your monthly budget.

### What is a Session?

A **session** is counted when a unique user scans your QR code and accesses your content. The same user scanning multiple times within 5 minutes counts as one session (deduplication).

### AI vs Non-AI Sessions

| Session Type | Description | Starter Cost | Premium Cost |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **AI Session** | Project has AI assistant enabled | $0.05 | $0.04 |
| **Non-AI Session** | Project has AI assistant disabled | $0.025 | $0.02 |

:::tip Save on Sessions
If your project doesn't need the AI voice assistant, disable it in project settings to pay the lower non-AI session rate.
:::

### Monthly Budget Examples

Your monthly budget is consumed as users access your projects:

**Starter ($40/month):**
- All AI projects: ~800 sessions ($40 ÷ $0.05)
- All non-AI projects: ~1,600 sessions ($40 ÷ $0.025)
- Mixed: 400 AI + 800 non-AI = $20 + $20 = $40

**Premium ($280/month):**
- All AI projects: ~7,000 sessions ($280 ÷ $0.04)
- All non-AI projects: ~14,000 sessions ($280 ÷ $0.02)
- Mixed: 3,500 AI + 7,000 non-AI = $140 + $140 = $280

Budget resets on your billing date each month.
