## Session-Based Billing

Starter and Premium plans use session-based billing where you pay per visitor session from your monthly budget.

### What is a Session?

A **session** is counted when a unique user scans your QR code and accesses your content. The same user scanning multiple times within 5 minutes counts as one session (deduplication).

### AI vs Non-AI Sessions

| Session Type | Description | Starter Cost | Premium Cost | Enterprise Cost |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **AI Session** | Project has AI assistant enabled | $0.05 | $0.04 | $0.02 |
| **Non-AI Session** | Project has AI assistant disabled | $0.025 | $0.02 | $0.01 |

:::tip Save on Sessions
If your project doesn't need the AI voice assistant, disable it in project settings to pay the lower non-AI session rate.
:::

### Monthly Budget Examples

Your monthly budget is consumed as users access your projects:

**Starter ($40/month):**
- All AI projects: ~800 sessions ($40 ÷ $0.05)
- All non-AI projects: ~1,600 sessions ($40 ÷ $0.025)
- Mixed: 400 AI + 800 non-AI = $20 + $20 = $40

**Premium ($280/month):**
- All AI projects: ~7,000 sessions ($280 ÷ $0.04)
- All non-AI projects: ~14,000 sessions ($280 ÷ $0.02)
- Mixed: 3,500 AI + 7,000 non-AI = $140 + $140 = $280

Budget resets on your billing date each month.

## Overage Credits (Paid Plans)

When your monthly budget is depleted, you can purchase additional credits:

1. Go to **Plan & Usage** in your dashboard
2. Click **Buy Credits**
3. Enter amount (minimum $5)
4. Complete payment via Stripe
5. Credits added to your account immediately

**Credit rates follow your plan's session costs:**
- Starter: $5 = ~100 AI sessions or ~200 non-AI sessions
- Premium: $5 = ~125 AI sessions or ~250 non-AI sessions
- Enterprise: $5 = ~250 AI sessions or ~500 non-AI sessions

:::info Credits Don't Expire
Purchased credits remain in your account until used. They don't expire and carry over across billing cycles.
:::

## Voice Credits

In addition to session-based billing, **real-time voice conversations** use a separate **voice credit** system:

- **1 credit = 1 voice call** with a time limit per call
- Voice credits are purchased separately via Stripe
- Available for all users (including Free tier)
- Credits never expire

:::info Voice Credits are Separate
Voice credits are independent from your monthly session budget. Session budget covers content access; voice credits cover real-time voice calls.
:::

## Daily Access Limits

In addition to the monthly budget, you can set **daily access limits** per QR code to:
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes
- Protect against abuse
- Distribute access evenly throughout the month

Configure daily limits in each project's QR Code settings.

To upgrade:

1. Navigate to **Plan & Usage** in your dashboard
2. Click "Upgrade to Starter", "Upgrade to Premium", or "Upgrade to Enterprise"
