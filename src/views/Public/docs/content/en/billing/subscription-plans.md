## Session-Based Billing

Starter and Premium plans use session-based billing where you pay per visitor session.

### What is a Session?

A **session** is counted when a unique visitor scans your QR code and accesses your content. The same visitor scanning multiple times within 5 minutes counts as one session.

### AI vs Non-AI Sessions

| Session Type | Description | Starter Cost | Premium Cost |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **AI Session** | Project has AI assistant enabled | $0.05 | $0.045 |
| **Non-AI Session** | Project has AI assistant disabled | $0.025 | $0.02 |

:::tip Save on Sessions
If your project doesn't need the AI voice assistant, disable it in project settings to pay the lower non-AI session rate.
:::

### Monthly Budget

Your monthly budget is consumed as visitors access your projects:

- **Starter**: $40/month = ~800 AI sessions OR ~1,600 non-AI sessions
- **Premium**: $280/month = ~6,222 AI sessions OR ~14,000 non-AI sessions

Budget resets on your billing date each month.

## Auto Top-up (Paid Plans)

When your monthly budget is depleted:

1. System automatically charges $5 to your payment method
2. You receive additional session credits:
   - **Starter**: 100 AI sessions OR 200 non-AI sessions
   - **Premium**: 111 AI sessions OR 250 non-AI sessions
3. Top-up credits never expire

:::info No Interruption
Auto top-up ensures your visitors always have access, even during busy periods.
:::

## Daily Access Limits

In addition to the monthly budget, you can set **daily access limits** per QR code to:
- Prevent unexpected usage spikes
- Protect against abuse
- Distribute access evenly throughout the month

Configure daily limits in each project's Digital Access settings.
