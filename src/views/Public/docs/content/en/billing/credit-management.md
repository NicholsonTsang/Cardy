## Credit Management

Credits are used for premium features like translations and overage access. Manage your credit balance from the Plan & Usage page.

## Understanding Credits

Credits are a flexible currency for:

- **Translations** - Multi-language content translation
- **Overage Access** - Additional visitor access beyond monthly limit (Premium only)

## Credit Usage

### Translation Credits

Translation costs depend on content length:

| Content Length | Credits |
|---------------|---------|
| Short item (< 100 words) | 1 credit |
| Medium item (100-500 words) | 2 credits |
| Long item (> 500 words) | 3 credits |

Each language translation is charged separately.

:::info Example
Translating 10 content items (average length) to 3 languages:
10 items × 2 credits × 3 languages = 60 credits
:::

### Overage Credits (Premium Only)

When your monthly access pool is exhausted:

- **5 credits = 100 additional access**
- Purchased access never expires
- Automatically consumed after monthly pool
