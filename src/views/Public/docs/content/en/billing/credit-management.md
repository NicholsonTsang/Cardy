## Credit Management

Credits provide additional session capacity when your monthly budget is depleted. Available for Starter and Premium subscribers.

## Understanding Credits

Credits let you continue serving your audience beyond your monthly session budget:

- **Flexible Access** - Purchase credits anytime to handle traffic spikes
- **Never Expire** - Credits carry over across billing cycles
- **Same Rates** - Credits use your plan's session costs

:::info Both Paid Plans Support Credits
Both Starter ($40/mo) and Premium ($280/mo) subscribers can purchase overage credits. Free tier users cannot purchase credits.
:::

## How Credits Work

3. Your audience experiences no interruption
4. Purchase more credits as needed

### Credit Conversion

Credits convert to sessions based on your plan and project type:

| Plan | AI Sessions per $5 | Non-AI Sessions per $5 |
|------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Starter** | ~100 sessions | ~200 sessions |
| **Premium** | ~125 sessions | ~250 sessions |
