## AI Assistant Configuration

The AI assistant is a powerful feature that allows visitors to have natural conversations about your content. Configure it properly to provide the best experience.

## AI Settings Overview

### Project-Level AI

Configure the general AI assistant that answers questions about your entire project:

- **AI Instructions** - Guide how the AI responds (tone, focus areas, restrictions)
- **Knowledge Base** - General information about your venue/project
- **Welcome Message** - Custom greeting when visitors start a conversation

### Content-Level AI

Each content item can have its own AI configuration:

- **Item Knowledge Base** - Specific details about this item
- **Item Welcome Message** - Custom greeting for item-specific conversations

## Writing Effective AI Instructions

:::tip Instruction Best Practices
Be specific about:
- Tone (formal, casual, friendly)
- Focus areas (history, recommendations, facts)
- Restrictions (avoid pricing discussions, don't make promises)
:::

Example instruction:
```
You are a friendly museum guide. Focus on art history and artist backgrounds. 
Keep answers concise but informative. Suggest related artworks when relevant.
Don't discuss artwork valuations or authentication.
```

## Building Knowledge Bases

The knowledge base provides context for AI responses. Include:

### For Projects
- Venue history and background
- Operating hours and location details
- General policies and guidelines
- Frequently asked questions

### For Content Items
- Detailed descriptions and history
- Creator/artist information
- Interesting facts and stories
- Related items or recommendations

:::info Knowledge Quality = AI Quality
The more detailed and accurate your knowledge base, the better the AI assistant will perform. Update it based on common visitor questions.

## Custom Welcome Messages

Welcome messages set the tone for visitor interactions:

**Project Welcome Example:**
> "Welcome to the Museum of Modern Art! I'm your AI guide. I can tell you about any artwork here, share artist stories, or recommend what to see based on your interests. What would you like to explore?"

**Item Welcome Example:**
> "You're looking at Vincent van Gogh's 'Starry Night'. I can share its history, Van Gogh's techniques, or how it influenced modern art. What interests you most?"

## Testing Your AI

Before publishing, test your AI configuration:

1. Use the Preview mode
2. Ask various questions a visitor might ask
3. Verify responses are accurate and helpful
4. Adjust instructions or knowledge base as needed
