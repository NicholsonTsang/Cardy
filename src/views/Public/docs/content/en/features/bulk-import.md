## Handling Errors

Common import errors and solutions:

### Missing Required Fields
- Ensure Name and Description columns are filled
- Remove empty rows from the spreadsheet

### Invalid Image URLs
- Verify URLs are publicly accessible
- Check for typos in URLs
- Ensure images are in supported formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)

### Duplicate Names
- Each item name must be unique within a project
- Add distinguishing details to duplicate names

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small** - Test with a few items first
2. **Validate URLs** - Check all image links before import
3. **Consistent Formatting** - Keep descriptions similar in length and style
4. **Backup Original** - Keep a copy of your Excel file
5. **Review After Import** - Verify all content imported correctly

## Updating Imported Content

After import, you can edit items individually:

- Click any item to open the editor
- Make changes and save
- Changes apply immediately
