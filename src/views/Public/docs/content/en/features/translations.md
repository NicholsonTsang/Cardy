## Managing Translations

### Translation Status

Each language shows its status:

- **Up to Date** - Translation matches current content
- **Outdated** - Source content has changed since translation
- **Not Translated** - Language not yet translated

### Updating Translations

When you update source content:

1. The translation status changes to "Outdated"
2. Click "Update Translation" to re-translate
3. Only changed content is re-processed

### Deleting Translations

To remove a language:

1. Open the Translation panel
2. Select languages to delete
3. Click delete (supports bulk deletion)
4. Confirm deletion

## Translation Best Practices

1. **Write clearly** - Simple, clear source text translates better
2. **Avoid idioms** - Idiomatic expressions may not translate well
3. **Use consistent terminology** - Maintain vocabulary consistency
4. **Review key content** - Prioritize reviewing high-traffic content
5. **Update regularly** - Keep translations in sync with source changes

## Visitor Language Selection
