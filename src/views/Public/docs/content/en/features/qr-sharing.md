## QR Code Sharing

QR codes are the primary way visitors access your digital experience. Create multiple QR codes per project, each with independent settings and tracking.

## Multi-QR Code System

Each project can have **multiple QR codes**, allowing you to:
- Track different locations separately (e.g., "Front Entrance", "Table 5", "Exhibition Hall A")
- Set different daily limits per QR code
- Enable/disable individual QR codes without affecting others
- Monitor usage statistics per QR code

:::tip Use Case Examples
- **Restaurant**: Create separate QR codes for each table
- **Museum**: Different codes for each exhibit area
- **Event**: Unique codes for different entry points
:::

## Creating QR Codes

### Your First QR Code

Every project automatically gets one QR code when created. To add more:

1. Open your project
2. Go to **Digital Access** settings
3. Click **Add QR Code**
4. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Main Entrance", "Table 12")
5. Configure settings and save

### QR Code Settings

Each QR code has independent settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Descriptive label for identification |
| **Enable/Disable** | Control public access for this specific QR |
| **Daily Limit** | Maximum scans per day for this QR code |
| **Access Token** | Unique identifier (can be refreshed individually) |

## Managing Multiple QR Codes

### Viewing All QR Codes

The Digital Access panel shows all QR codes for your project with:
- Current status (enabled/disabled)
- Daily usage statistics
- Monthly session count
- Quick actions (edit, download, refresh, delete)

### Per-QR Statistics

Each QR code tracks its own:
- **Today's Sessions**: Scans today
- **Monthly Sessions**: Scans this billing period
- **Total Sessions**: All-time scan count

:::info Billing Note
All QR code sessions for a project count toward your monthly session budget. The per-QR tracking helps you understand which locations drive the most traffic.

## Best Practices

### Naming Convention

Use clear, descriptive names for easy identification:
- ✅ "Main Entrance - Building A"
- ✅ "Table 15 - Patio Section"
- ✅ "Mona Lisa - Gallery 3"
- ❌ "QR Code 1"
- ❌ "New Code"

### Placement Tips

- Place at eye level when possible
- Ensure adequate lighting for scanning
- Include brief instructions ("Scan to learn more")
- Avoid reflective surfaces behind the code

### Size Guidelines

| Use Case | Minimum Size |
|----------|-------------|
| Table card | 2.5 x 2.5 cm |
| Wall plaque | 5 x 5 cm |
| Large signage | 10 x 10 cm |
| Outdoor display | 15 x 15 cm |

### Testing

Always test your QR codes before deployment:

1. Print a sample at intended size
2. Test scanning from expected distances
3. Test in various lighting conditions
4. Verify the correct content loads
5. Test the AI assistant interaction

## Refreshing Access Tokens

Each QR code has its own access token. You can refresh individual tokens if:
- You suspect unauthorized sharing
- You want to invalidate old printed materials
- Security concerns arise

:::warning Token Refresh
When you refresh a QR code's token, all existing copies of that specific QR code will stop working. Other QR codes for the same project are not affected.
:::

To refresh a token:
1. Open the QR code settings
2. Click the refresh icon
3. Confirm the action
4. Download and redistribute the new QR code

## Access Limits

Control how each QR code is used:

### Daily Limits (Per QR Code)

- Set individual daily scan limits
- Prevents unexpected usage spikes on specific codes
- Protects against abuse at specific locations
- Resets at midnight

### Monthly Budget (Account Level)

Your monthly session budget is shared across all projects and QR codes:
- **Free**: 50 sessions/month
- **Starter**: $40 budget (~800-1,600 sessions)
- **Premium**: $280 budget (~7,000-14,000 sessions)

## Deleting QR Codes

To remove a QR code:
1. Open the QR code settings
2. Click the delete button
3. Confirm deletion

:::important Minimum Requirement
Each project must have at least one QR code. You cannot delete the last remaining QR code.

## Mobile Experience

When visitors scan your QR code:

1. Content loads instantly in their browser
2. No app download required
3. Language selector available (10 languages)
