## Adding Content to Your Project

Content items are the individual pieces of information that visitors will explore. Each item can include text, images, and AI-powered descriptions.

## Types of Content

Depending on your content mode, you can add:

- **Individual items** - Standalone content pieces (artworks, menu items, products)
- **Grouped items** - Content organized into categories (gallery floors, menu sections)
- **Sub-items** - Nested content within parent items

## Step-by-Step Guide

- **Description** - Detailed information visitors will see
- **Image** - Visual representation of the item
- **AI Knowledge Base** - Additional context for the AI assistant
- **Item Welcome Message** - Custom greeting when visitors ask the AI about this item

## Adding Sub-Items

For grouped content modes, you can add sub-items under parent categories:

1. Create a parent item (e.g., "Appetizers")
2. Click on the parent item to expand it
3. Click "Add Sub-item" to create nested content
4. Fill in sub-item details as usual

## Content Organization

### Flat vs Grouped

- **Flat layouts** (List, Grid, Cards): Items appear at the same level
- **Grouped content**: Items can have parent-child relationships with category headers

:::warning Flat Layout with Hierarchy
If you have parent-child content but disable grouping, only the leaf items (children with no sub-items) will display. Parent items act as organizational containers.

## Translating Content

After adding content, you can translate it to other languages (paid plans):

1. Complete all content in your source language
2. Open the Translation panel
3. Select target languages
4. Run automatic translation
5. Review and edit as needed

All content fields are translated, including AI knowledge bases.
