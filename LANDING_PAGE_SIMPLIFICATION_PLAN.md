# Landing Page Simplification Plan

## Goal
Make the landing page more concise with only essential content, reducing from ~1500 lines to ~800-900 lines.

## Current Structure Analysis

### Sections to KEEP (Essential)
1. ✅ **Hero Section** - Core value proposition and CTAs
2. ✅ **Demo Section** - Live demo card with features
3. ✅ **Pricing Section** - Critical for sales conversion
4. ✅ **Contact Section** - Lead generation
5. ✅ **Footer** - Basic information and links

### Sections to REMOVE (Non-Essential)
1. ❌ **About Section** (~40 lines) - Merge 1-sentence version into Hero
2. ❌ **Applications Carousel** (~120 lines) - Too detailed, covered in FAQ
3. ❌ **Benefits Section** (~40 lines) - Redundant with Key Features
4. ❌ **Sustainability Impact** (~100 lines) - Nice-to-have, not core value
5. ❌ **Collaboration Models** (~150 lines) - Too detailed, simplify to pricing note

### Sections to SIMPLIFY
1. 📝 **How it Works** - Reduce from 4 steps to 3 steps (~15% reduction)
2. 📝 **Key Features** - Reduce from 6 features to 4 core features (~33% reduction)
3. 📝 **FAQ** - Reduce from 9 questions to 6 most important (~33% reduction)
