## 🎨 **Visual Consistency**

Both new tabs use the **exact same components** as the Card Issuer's MyCards view:

**Card Issuer MyCards:**
```
Tabs: General | Content | Issuance | QR & Access | Preview | Import/Export
                                      ↑ Same     ↑ Same
```

**Admin User Cards Viewer:**
```
Tabs: General | Content | Issuance | QR & Access | Preview
                                      ↑ Same     ↑ Same
```

**Differences:**
- Admin view: **5 tabs** (no Import/Export)
- Card Issuer view: **6 tabs** (includes Import/Export)
- All tabs are **read-only** in admin view
