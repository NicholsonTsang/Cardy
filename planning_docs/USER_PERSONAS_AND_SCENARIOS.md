# Real-Life Scenarios & Target User Personas

This document supplements the technical planning with rich, real-life narratives. It defines **Who** uses each mode, **Why** they choose it, and **What** the experience looks like.

## 1. SOLO Mode (Profile)

**The "Digital Business Card" & "Single Identity"**
*Focus: Identity, Contact, Connection.*

| Target User | Real-Life Scenario | The "Win" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Real Estate Agent** | **"The Open House Leave-Behind"**<br>Agents usually leave paper cards that get thrown away. Instead, they leave a premium metal card on the kitchen counter. Visitors scan it to see the agent's photo, bio, "Click to Call" button, and a link to the property listing. | Permanent impression. Visitors save the contact directly to their phone (VCF). |
| **Freelance Consultant** | **"The Conference Handshake"**<br>At a busy networking event, instead of fumbling for paper cards, the consultant flashes a QR code on their phone lock screen. The prospect scans it, sees a professional bio, LinkedIn link, and "Book a Consultation" button. | Instant connection. No data entry error. |
| **Pet Owner** | **"The Smart Dog Tag"**<br>A dog wears a durable tag with a QR code. If lost, the finder scans it. They see the dog's photo, name, medical needs, and the owner's direct phone number. | Privacy (phone number isn't visible to naked eye) + dynamic updates (can change "I'm lost" status). |

## 2. STACK Mode (Links)

**The "Link-in-Bio" & "Resource Hub"**
*Focus: Efficiency, Traffic Routing, Utilities.*

| Target User | Real-Life Scenario | The "Win" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Influencer / Creator** | **"The Social Hub"**<br>Instagram only allows one link. The creator uses this card as their bio link. It lists: "Latest YouTube Video," "Merch Store," "Patreon," and "Amazon Wishlist." | Updates all links in one place without changing the bio URL. |
| **Airbnb Host** | **"The Fridge Magnet"**<br>A magnet on the rental's fridge. Guests scan it to see a list of quick links: "WiFi Password," "House Manual PDF," "Best Pizza Delivery," "Emergency Contacts." | Reduces repetitive questions ("What's the wifi?"). |
| **Event Organizer** | **"The Virtual Swag Bag"**<br>Instead of a plastic bag full of flyers, attendees get one card. It lists: "Speaker Slides," "Sponsor Coupons," "Feedback Form," and "Next Year's Pre-sale." | Eco-friendly. Analytics show which sponsor links were actually clicked. |

## 3. CATALOG Mode (Grid)

**The "Visual Gallery" & "Digital Menu"**
*Focus: Discovery, Browsing, Visual Appeal.*

| Target User | Real-Life Scenario | The "Win" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Visual Artist** | **"The Gallery Tag"**<br>Next to a painting in a gallery, there's a small card. Scanning it shows the artist's full portfolio grid. Visitors can browse other works, read the inspiration behind them, and see prices. | Upsell opportunity ("See more like this"). Bridges physical art with digital portfolio. |
| **Restaurant Owner** | **"The Dynamic Menu"**<br>A QR code on the table wood block. It opens a grid of today's specials with mouth-watering photos. Unlike a paper menu, it updates instantly when the "Fresh Catch" runs out. | Higher check size (photos sell food). Inventory control (hide sold-out items). |
| **Boutique Hotel** | **"The Room Concierge"**<br>A card on the nightstand. Scanning opens a visual grid: "Room Service," "Spa Treatments," "Pool Hours," "Local Tours." Clicking "Spa" shows photos of the massage rooms. | Visual luxury. Encourages booking services. |

## 4. GUIDE Mode (Tour)

**The "Interactive Manual" & "Storyteller"**
*Focus: Education, Sequence, Depth.*

| Target User | Real-Life Scenario | The "Win" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Museum Curator** | **"The Pocket Docent"**<br>Visitors buy a souvenir card at the entrance. It guides them through the "Egypt Hall" (Parent Item). Clicking it reveals specific artifacts: "The Mummy," "The Sarcophagus" (Sub-items). Each has audio/text. | Replaces expensive audio hardware. Visitors keep the educational content as a souvenir. |
| **Product Manufacturer** | **"The Smart User Manual"**<br>A high-end coffee machine comes with a QR card. It opens a guide: "Getting Started" (Parent). Inside are steps: "1. Fill Water," "2. Grind Beans," "3. Brew." | Reduces support calls. Video/GIFs explain better than paper text. |
| **City Tourism Board** | **"The Historic Walk"**<br>Posters at 5 landmarks. Scanning one unlocks the full "Old Town Tour." It lists the 5 stops. Visitors walk from one to the next, "collecting" the stories. | Promotes foot traffic. Decentralized tourism. |

| **Equipment Rental** | **"Instant Support"**<br>*Base Mode: Solo/Stack.*<br>On a rented generator. Worker scans it: "How do I start this in the rain?" The AI (fed with the manual) answers instantly. | Safety. Instant answers without searching through PDFs. |
| **Winery** | **" The Sommelier"**<br>*Base Mode: Catalog.*<br>On a wine bottle. "What cheese pairs with this?" The AI recommends specific cheeses and explains the flavor profile. | Educates the customer. Adds premium value to the product. |
