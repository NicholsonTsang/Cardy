# Unified Header Implementation - Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully created a unified header component that serves both the landing page and dashboard, providing consistent branding while adapting to different contexts.

## Key Changes

**File:** `src/layouts/AppLayout.vue`

- Replaced `AppHeader` with `<UnifiedHeader mode="dashboard">`

### 4. Updated Documentation
**File:** `CLAUDE.md`

- Updated component descriptions
- Updated project structure
- Added note about unified header in landing page section

## Technical Details

- **Component Props**: `mode: 'landing' | 'dashboard'`
- **Events**: `scroll-to`, `toggle-mobile-menu` (landing mode only)
- **Responsive**: Navigation links hide on mobile (< 1024px)
- **Authentication**: Automatically detects login state and adapts UI
- **Credit Display**: Shows credit balance for card issuers in dashboard mode

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent Branding**: Same logo, colors, and design across landing and dashboard
✅ **Better UX**: Logged-in users see familiar dropdown on landing page
✅ **Maintainable**: Single source of truth for header logic
✅ **DRY**: No code duplication between landing and dashboard
✅ **Flexible**: Easy to add new modes or features

## Testing Status

All linter checks passed ✅

## Next Steps

To verify the implementation:

1. **Test Landing Page (Not Logged In)**
   - Visit `/` and verify navigation links are visible
   - Check Sign In and Sign Up buttons are present
   - Test scroll navigation (About, Demo, Pricing, Contact)
   - Test mobile menu on small screens

2. **Test Landing Page (Logged In)**
   - Sign in and visit `/`
   - Verify user dropdown appears instead of Sign In/Sign Up
   - Check navigation links still work
   - Test dropdown menu functionality

3. **Test Dashboard**
   - Navigate to `/cms/mycards` or `/cms/admin`
   - Verify navigation links are NOT shown
   - Check user dropdown is present
   - For card issuers, verify credit balance displays
   - Test all dropdown menu items

4. **Test Responsive Behavior**
   - Test at various screen sizes
   - Verify mobile menu on landing page (< 1024px)
   - Check all interactive elements work on mobile
